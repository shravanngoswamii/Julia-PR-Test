                  which indicates the representativeness of a sample
                  from a distribution, to deÔ¨Åne a measure of the
                  representativeness of an item to a set. We show that
                  this measure is formally related to a machine
                  learning method known as Bayesian Sets. Building on
                  this connection, we derive an analytic expression
                  for the representativeness of objects described by a
                  sparse vector of binary features. We then apply this
                  measure to a large database of images, using it to
                  determine which images are the most representative
                  members of different sets. Comparing the resulting
                  predictions to human judgments of representativeness
                  provides a test of this measure with naturalistic
                  stimuli, and illustrates how databases that are more
                  commonly used in computer vision and machine

                  appealing in this situation, as a model of the

                  present a nonparametric Bayesian method that uses

                  avoiding many of the problems associated with
                  Dirichlet process mixture models. Our model is fully

                  in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to provide a

                  network, particularly one with hidden units. The

  abstract =	 {Interpretability of representations in both deep
                  generative and discriminative models is highly
                  desirable. Current methods jointly optimize an
                  objective combining accuracy and interpretability.
                  However, this may reduce accuracy, and is not
                  applicable to already trained models. We propose two
                  interpretability frameworks. First, we provide an
                  interpretable lens for an existing model. We use a
                  generative model which takes as input the
                  representation in an existing (generative or
                  discriminative) model, weakly supervised by limited
                  side information. Applying a flexible and invertible
                  transformation to the input leads to an
                  interpretable representation with no loss in
                  accuracy. We extend the approach using an active
                  learning strategy to choose the most useful side
                  information to obtain, allowing a human to guide
                  what ``interpretable" means. Our second framework
                  relies on joint optimization for a representation
                  which is both maximally informative about the side
                  information and maximally compressive about the
                  non-interpretable data factors.  This leads to a
                  novel perspective on the relationship between
                  compression and regularization.  We also propose a
                  new interpretability evaluation metric based on our
                  framework. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art
                  results on three datasets using the two proposed
                  algorithms.}

                  performance, including fairness. Fairness here means
                  that the outcome of an automated decision-making
                  system should not discriminate between subgroups
                  characterized by sensitive attributes such as gender
                  or race. Given any existing differentiable
                  classifier, we make only slight adjustments to the
                  architecture including adding a new hidden layer, in
                  order to enable the concurrent adversarial
                  optimization for fairness and accuracy. Our

                  is scalable transferability among complex
                  tasks. Incorporating a graphical model (GM), along
                  with the rich family of related methods, as a basis
                  for RL frameworks provides potential to address
                  issues such as transferability, generalisation and
                  exploration. Here we propose a flexible GM-based RL
                  framework which leverages efficient inference
                  procedures to enhance generalisation and transfer
                  power. In our proposed transferable and
                  information-based graphical model framework ‚ÄòTibGM‚Äô,
                  we show the equivalence between our mutual

                  consolidated objective consisting of a standard
                  reward maximisation target and a
                  generalisation/transfer objective. In settings where
                  there is a sparse or deceptive reward signal, our
                  TibGM framework is flexible enough to incorporate
                  exploration bonuses depicting intrinsic rewards. We

                  gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which
                  combines gauge transformations with the weighted
                  mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method.  WMBE-G can
                  provide both upper and lower bounds on Z, and is
                  easier to optimize than the prior gauge-variational
                  algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves the
                  earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models
                  including Ising models with no magnetic field. Our
                  experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness
                  of WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models.},

                  generally computationally intractable, leading to
                  extensive study of approximation methods. Iterative

                  ensembles of neural networks and sparse mixture of

                  comprehensive evaluation of sparse MoEs in

                  level in each voxel, has the advantage that model
                  parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD is
                  compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using
                  a common threshold for the singular values and to
                  SVD using a threshold optimized according to the
                  noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried
                  out using artificial data as well as using data from
                  healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is
                  comparable to SVD variable optimized threshold when
                  determining the maximum of the IRF, which is
                  directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a
                  better estimate of the entire IRF. As the signal to
                  noise ratio increases or the time resolution of the
                  measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior
                  to SVD. This is also found for large distribution

                  we perform probabilistic reasoning over the depth of

                  are able to both evaluate our training objective and
                  make predictions with a single forward pass. We

                  change an input, while keeping it on the data
                  manifold, such that a BNN becomes more confident
                  about the input's prediction. We validate CLUE
                  through 1) a novel framework for evaluating
                  counterfactual explanations of uncertainty, 2) a
                  series of ablation experiments, and 3) a user

                  about an opportunity to deploy machine learning
                  models on new problem domains using previously
                  inaccessible data. Traditional algorithms for
                  training such models often require data to be stored
                  on a single machine with compute performed by a
                  single node, making them unsuitable for
                  decentralised training on multiple devices. This
                  deficiency has motivated the development of
                  federated learning algorithms, which allow multiple
                  data owners to train collaboratively and use a
                  shared model whilst keeping local data
                  private. However, many of these algorithms focus on
                  obtaining point estimates of model parameters,
                  rather than probabilistic estimates capable of
                  capturing model uncertainty, which is essential in
                  many applications. Variational inference (VI) has
                  become the method of choice for fitting many modern
                  probabilistic models. In this paper we introduce
                  partitioned variational inference (PVI), a general
                  framework for performing VI in the federated
                  setting. We develop new supporting theory for PVI,
                  demonstrating a number of properties that make it an
                  attractive choice for practitioners; use PVI to
                  unify a wealth of fragmented, yet related
                  literature; and provide empirical results that
                  showcase the effectiveness of PVI in a variety of
                  federated settings.},

                  are omnipresent in modern science and
                  engineering. An effective framework for handling
                  such data are Gaussian process deep generative
                  models (GP-DGMs), which employ GP priors over the
                  latent variables of DGMs. Existing approaches for
                  performing inference in GP-DGMs do not support
                  sparse GP approximations based on inducing points,
                  which are essential for the computational efficiency
                  of GPs, nor do they handle missing data -- a natural
                  occurrence in many spatio-temporal datasets -- in a
                  principled manner. We address these shortcomings
                  with the development of the sparse Gaussian process
                  variational autoencoder (SGP-VAE), characterised by
                  the use of partial inference networks for
                  parameterising sparse GP approximations. Leveraging
                  the benefits of amortised variational inference, the

                  on previously unobserved data with no additional
                  training. The SGP-VAE is evaluated in a variety of
                  experiments where it outperforms alternative
                  approaches including multi-output GPs and structured

                  model class in spatial statistics. They encode prior
                  information about the modeled function and can be
                  used for exact or approximate Bayesian inference. In
                  many applications, particularly in physical sciences
                  and engineering, but also in areas such as
                  geostatistics and neuroscience, invariance to
                  symmetries is one of the most fundamental forms of
                  prior information one can consider. The invariance
                  of a Gaussian process' covariance to such symmetries
                  gives rise to the most natural generalization of the
                  concept of stationarity to such spaces. In this
                  work, we develop constructive and practical
                  techniques for building stationary Gaussian
                  processes on a very large class of non-Euclidean
                  spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our
                  techniques make it possible to (i) calculate
                  covariance kernels and (ii) sample from prior and
                  posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces,
                  both in a practical manner. This work is split into
                  two parts, each involving different technical
                  considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while
                  part II studies non-compact spaces possessing
                  certain structure. Our contributions make the
                  non-Euclidean Gaussian process models we study
                  compatible with well-understood computational
                  techniques available in standard Gaussian process

                  (CP) is a well established line of research that
                  focuses on building a theoretically grounded,
                  calibrated prediction set, which may contain

                  be very large, which leads to unhelpful AI
                  assistants. To mitigate this, we introduce D-CP, a
                  method to perform CP on some examples and defer to
                  experts. We prove that D-CP can reduce the

                  that CP prediction sets improve human-AI team
                  performance over showing the top-1 prediction alone,
                  and that experts find D-CP prediction sets are more

                  encountered in machine learning are instances of one
                  of four abstract, fundamental problems: sampling,
                  integration, optimization, and search.  Thanks to
                  the rich history of the respective mathematical
                  fields, disparate methods with different properties
                  have been developed for these four problem classes.
                  As a result it can be beneficial to convert a
                  problem from one abstract class into a problem of a
                  different class, because the latter might come with
                  insights, techniques, and algorithms well suited to
                  the particular problem at hand. In particular, this
                  thesis contributes four new methods and
                  generalizations of existing methods for converting
                  specific non-optimization machine learning tasks
                  into optimization problems with more appealing
                  properties.  The first example is partition function
                  estimation (an integration problem), where an
                  existing algorithm -- the Gumbel trick -- for
                  converting to the MAP optimization problem is
                  generalized into a more general family of
                  algorithms, such that other instances of this family
                  have better statistical properties. Second, this
                  family of algorithms is further generalized to
                  another integration problem, the problem of
                  estimating R√©nyi entropies. The third example shows
                  how an intractable sampling problem arising when
                  wishing to publicly release a database containing
                  sensitive data in a safe ("differentially private")
                  manner can be converted into an optimization problem
                  using the theory of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert
                  Spaces. Finally, the fourth case study casts the
                  challenging discrete search problem of program
                  synthesis from input-output examples as a supervised
                  learning task that can be efficiently tackled using
                  gradient-based optimization.  In all four instances,
                  the conversions result in novel algorithms with
                  desirable properties. In the first instance, new
                  generalizations of the Gumbel trick can be used to
                  construct statistical estimators of the partition
                  function that achieve the same estimation error
                  while using up to 40% fewer samples. The second
                  instance shows that unbiased estimators of the R√©nyi
                  entropy can be constructed in the Perturb-and-MAP
                  framework. The main contribution of the third
                  instance is theoretical: the conversion shows that
                  it is possible to construct an algorithm for
                  releasing synthetic databases that approximate
                  databases containing sensitive data in a
                  mathematically precise sense, and to prove results
                  about their approximation errors. Finally, the
                  fourth conversion yields an algorithm for
                  synthesising program source code from input-output
                  examples that is able to solve test problems 1-3
                  orders of magnitude faster than a wide range of
                  baselines.}

                  sparse representation of graph adjacency
                  matrices. As we look to scale up these models using

                  protected. The proposed framework rests on two main
                  ideas. First, releasing (an estimate of) the kernel
                  mean embedding of the data generating random

                  third-parties to construct consistent estimators of
                  a wide class of population statistics. Second, the
                  algorithm can satisfy the definition of differential
                  privacy by basing the released kernel mean embedding
                  on entirely synthetic data points, while controlling
                  accuracy through the metric available in a

                  results guaranteeing differential privacy of the

                  discrete probability distribution, or to estimate
                  its normalizing partition function.  The method
                  relies on repeatedly applying a random perturbation
                  to the distribution in a particular way, each time
                  solving for the most likely configuration. We derive
                  an entire family of related methods, of which the
                  Gumbel trick is one member, and show that the new
                  methods have superior properties in several settings
                  with minimal additional computational cost. In
                  particular, for the Gumbel trick to yield
                  computational benefits for discrete graphical
                  models, Gumbel perturbations on all configurations
                  are typically replaced with so-called low-rank

                  series data obtained from a well-established model
                  of T cell activation. SSMs are a class of dynamic
                  Bayesian networks in which the observed measurements
                  depend on some hidden state variables that evolve
                  according to Markovian dynamics. These hidden
                  variables can capture effects that cannot be
                  directly measured in a gene expression profiling
                  experiment, for example: genes that have not been
                  included in the microarray, levels of regulatory
                  proteins, the effects of mRNA and protein
                  degradation, etc.  Results: We have approached the
                  problem of inferring the model structure of these
                  state-space models using both classical and Bayesian
                  methods. In our previous work, a bootstrap procedure
                  was used to derive classical confidence intervals
                  for parameters representing `gene--gene'
                  interactions over time. In this article, variational
                  approximations are used to perform the analogous
                  model selection task in the Bayesian
                  context. Certain interactions are present in both
                  the classical and the Bayesian analyses of these
                  regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB
                  and JunD at the centre of the mechanisms that
                  control apoptosis and proliferation. These
                  mechanisms are key for clonal expansion and for
                  controlling the long term behavior (e.g. programmed
                  cell death) of these cells.}

                  we can implicitly integrate out the infinitely many

                  hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing
                  a rich set of transition dynamics. The three

                  it encounters, and as such it must, either
                  implicitly or explicitly, model the way these
                  elements interact to create the image. Do the
                  response properties of cells in the mammalian visual
                  system reflect this constraint? To address this
                  question, we constructed a probabilistic model in
                  which the identity and attributes of simple visual
                  elements were represented explicitly and learnt the
                  parameters of this model from unparsed, natural
                  video sequences. After learning, the behaviour and
                  grouping of variables in the probabilistic model
                  corresponded closely to functional and anatomical
                  properties of simple and complex cells in the
                  primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, feature
                  identity variables were activated in a way that
                  resembled the activity of complex cells, while
                  feature attribute variables responded much like
                  simple cells. Furthermore, the grouping of the
                  attributes within the model closely parallelled the
                  reported anatomical grouping of simple cells in cat
                  V1. Thus, this generative model makes explicit an
                  interpretation of complex and simple cells as
                  elements in the segmentation of a visual scene into
                  basic independent features, along with a
                  parametrisation of their moment-by-moment
                  appearances. We speculate that such a segmentation
                  may form the initial stage of a hierarchical system
                  that progressively separates the identity and
                  appearance of more articulated visual elements,
                  culminating in view-invariant object recognition.},

                  properties to various stakeholders for purposes that
                  include understanding, improving, and contesting
                  predictions. Until now, most research into
                  algorithmic transparency has predominantly focused
                  on explainability. Explainability attempts to
                  provide reasons for a machine learning model's
                  behavior to stakeholders. However, understanding a
                  model's specific behavior alone might not be enough
                  for stakeholders to gauge whether the model is wrong
                  or lacks sufficient knowledge to solve the task at
                  hand. In this paper, we argue for considering a
                  complementary form of transparency by estimating and
                  communicating the uncertainty associated with model
                  predictions. First, we discuss methods for assessing
                  uncertainty. Then, we characterize how uncertainty
                  can be used to mitigate model unfairness, augment
                  decision-making, and build trustworthy
                  systems. Finally, we outline methods for displaying
                  uncertainty to stakeholders and recommend how to
                  collect information required for incorporating
                  uncertainty into existing ML pipelines. This work

                  model but rather for machine learning engineers, who
                  use explainability to debug the model itself. There
                  is thus a gap between explainability in practice and
                  the goal of transparency, since explanations
                  primarily serve internal stakeholders rather than
                  external ones. Our study synthesizes the limitations
                  of current explainability techniques that hamper
                  their use for end users. To facilitate end user
                  interaction, we develop a framework for establishing
                  clear goals for explainability. We end by discussing
                  concerns raised regarding explainability.}

                  and manipulation, it is difficult to program desired
                  task solutions beforehand, as robots are within an
                  uncertain and dynamic environment. In such cases,
                  learning tasks from experience can be a useful
                  alternative. To obtain a sound learning and
                  generalization performance, machine learning,
                  especially, reinforcement learning, usually requires
                  sufficient data. However, in cases where only little
                  data is available for learning, due to system
                  constraints and practical issues, reinforcement
                  learning can act suboptimally. In this paper, we
                  investigate how model-based reinforcement learning,
                  in particular the probabilistic inference for
                  learning control method (PILCO), can be tailored to
                  cope with the case of sparse data to speed up
                  learning. The basic idea is to include further prior
                  knowledge into the learning process. As PILCO is
                  built on the probabilistic Gaussian processes
                  framework, additional system knowledge can be
                  incorporated by defining appropriate prior
                  distributions, e.g. a linear mean Gaussian
                  prior. The resulting PILCO formulation remains in
                  closed form and analytically tractable. The proposed
                  approach is evaluated in simulation as well as on a
                  physical robot, the Festo Robotino XT. For the robot
                  evaluation, we employ the approach for learning an
                  object pick-up task. The results show that by
                  including prior knowledge, policy learning can be
                  sped up in presence of sparse data.}

                  NMR chemical shifts are becoming increasingly
                  common. The most widely used approaches adopt the
                  molecular fragment replacement strategy, in which
                  structural fragments are repeatedly reassembled into
                  different complete conformations in molecular
                  simulations. Although these approaches are effective
                  in generating individual structures consistent with
                  the chemical shift data, they do not enable the
                  sampling of the conformational space of proteins
                  with correct statistical weights. Here, we present a
                  method of molecular fragment replacement that makes
                  it possible to perform equilibrium simulations of
                  proteins, and hence to determine their free energy
                  landscapes. This strategy is based on the encoding
                  of the chemical shift information in a probabilistic
                  model in Markov chain Monte Carlo
                  simulations. First, we demonstrate that with this
                  approach it is possible to fold proteins to their
                  native states starting from extended
                  structures. Second, we show that the method
                  satisfies the detailed balance condition and hence
                  it can be used to carry out an equilibrium sampling
                  from the Boltzmann distribution corresponding to the
                  force field used in the simulations. Third, by
                  comparing the results of simulations carried out
                  with and without chemical shift restraints we
                  describe quantitatively the effects that these
                  restraints have on the free energy landscapes of
                  proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate
                  that the molecular fragment replacement strategy can
                  be used in combination with chemical shift
                  information to characterize not only the native
                  structures of proteins but also their conformational

                  discriminative latent variable models which have
                  been shown to successfully learn the hidden
                  structure of a given classification problem. An
                  infinite HCRF is an HCRF with a countably infinite
                  number of hidden states, which rids us not only of
                  the necessity to specify a priori a fixed number of
                  hidden states available but also of the problem of
                  overfitting. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
                  sampling algorithms are often employed for inference
                  in such models. However, convergence of such
                  algorithms is rather difficult to verify, and as the
                  complexity of the task at hand increases, the
                  computational cost of such algorithms often becomes
                  prohibitive. These limitations can be overcome by
                  variational techniques. In this paper, we present a
                  generalized framework for infinite HCRF models, and
                  a novel variational inference approach on a model
                  based on coupled Dirichlet Process Mixtures, the
                  HCRF--DPM. We show that the variational HCRF--DPM is
                  able to converge to a correct number of represented
                  hidden states, and performs as well as the best
                  parametric HCRFs ---chosen via cross--validation---
                  for the difficult tasks of recognizing instances of

                  Bellman's equations over information states is
                  notoriously intractable. Approximate adaptive
                  controllers often rely on the principle of
                  certainty-equivalence where the control process
                  deals with parameter point estimates as if they
                  represented ``true'' parameter values. Here we
                  present a stochastic control rule instead where
                  controls are sampled from a posterior distribution
                  over a set of probabilistic input-output models and
                  the true model is identified by Bayesian
                  inference. This allows reformulating the adaptive
                  control problem as an inference and sampling problem
                  derived from a minimum relative entropy principle.
                  Importantly, inference and action sampling both work
                  forward in time and hence such a Bayesian adaptive
                  controller is applicable on-line. We demonstrate the

  abstract =	 {Path integral methods have recently been shown to be
                  applicable to a very general class of optimal
                  control problems. Here we examine the path integral
                  formalism from a decision-theoretic point of view,
                  since an optimal controller can always be regarded
                  as an instance of a perfectly rational
                  decision-maker that chooses its actions so as to
                  maximize its expected utility. The problem with
                  perfect rationality is, however, that finding
                  optimal actions is often very difficult due to
                  prohibitive computational resource costs that are
                  not taken into account. In contrast, a bounded
                  rational decision-maker has only limited resources
                  and therefore needs to strike some compromise
                  between the desired utility and the required
                  resource costs. In particular, we suggest an
                  information-theoretic measure of resource costs that
                  can be derived axiomatically. As a consequence we
                  obtain a variational principle for choice
                  probabilities that trades off maximizing a given
                  utility criterion and avoiding resource costs that
                  arise due to deviating from initially given default
                  choice probabilities. The resulting bounded rational
                  policies are in general probabilistic. We show that
                  the solutions found by the path integral formalism
                  are such bounded rational policies. Furthermore, we
                  show that the same formalism generalizes to discrete
                  control problems, leading to linearly solvable
                  bounded rational control policies in the case of
                  Markov systems. Importantly, Bellman's optimality
                  principle is not presupposed by this variational
                  principle, but it can be derived as a limit
                  case. This suggests that the information theoretic
                  formalization of bounded rationality might serve as
                  a general principle in control design that unifies a
                  number of recently reported approximate optimal
                  control methods both in the continuous and discrete
                  domain.},

                  two-person motor game that requires coordination. In
                  this study, we investigate coordination in
                  sensorimotor tasks that correspond to classic
                  coordination games with multiple Nash equilibria,
                  such as "choosing sides", "stag hunt", "chicken",
                  and "battle of sexes". In these tasks, subjects made
                  reaching movements reflecting their continuously
                  evolving "decisions" while they received a
                  continuous payoff in the form of a resistive force
                  counteracting their movements. Successful
                  coordination required two subjects to "choose" the
                  same Nash equilibrium in this force-payoff landscape
                  within a single reach. We found that on the majority
                  of trials coordination was achieved. Compared to the
                  proportion of trials in which miscoordination
                  occurred, successful coordination was characterized
                  by several distinct features: an increased mutual
                  information between the players' movement endpoints,
                  an increased joint entropy during the movements, and
                  by differences in the timing of the players'
                  responses.  Moreover, we found that the probability
                  of successful coordination depends on the players'
                  initial distance from the Nash equilibria. Our
                  results suggest that two-person coordination arises
                  naturally in motor interactions and is facilitated
                  by favorable initial positions, stereotypical motor
                  pattern, and differences in response times.},

                  inference method based on the minimization of
                  Œ±-divergences. BB-Œ±scales to large datasets because
                  it can be implemented using stochastic gradient
                  descent. BB-Œ±can be applied to complex probabilistic
                  models with little effort since it only requires as
                  input the likelihood function and its
                  gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained
                  using automatic differentiation. By changing the
                  divergence parameter Œ±, the method is able to
                  interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) (Œ±‚Üí0) and
                  an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP)
                  (Œ±= 1). Experiments on probit regression and neural
                  network regression and classification problems show
                  that BB-Œ±with non-standard settings of Œ±, such as Œ±=
                  0.5, usually produces better predictions than with
                  Œ±‚Üí0 (VB) or Œ±= 1 (EP).  the ultimatum game or the
                  prisoner's dilemma typically lead to Nash equilibria
                  when multiple competitive decision makers with
                  perfect knowledge select optimal
                  strategies. However, in evolutionary game theory it
                  has been shown that Nash equilibria can also arise
                  as attractors in dynamical systems that can
                  describe, for example, the population dynamics of
                  microorganisms. Similar to such evolutionary
                  dynamics, we find that Nash equilibria arise
                  naturally in motor interactions in which players vie
                  for control and try to minimize effort. When
                  confronted with sensorimotor interaction tasks that
                  correspond to the classical prisoner's dilemma and
                  the rope-pulling game, two-player motor interactions
                  led predominantly to Nash solutions. In contrast,
                  when a single player took both roles, playing the
                  sensorimotor game bimanually, cooperative solutions
                  were found. Our methodology opens up a new avenue
                  for the study of human motor interactions within a
                  game theoretic framework, suggesting that the
                  coupling of motor systems can lead to game theoretic
                  solutions.},

                  machine learning. GPstruct is a recently proposed
                  structured prediction model that offers appealing
                  properties such as being kernelised, non-parametric,
                  and supporting Bayesian inference (Brati√®res et
                  al. 2013).  The model places a Gaussian process
                  prior over energy functions which describe
                  relationships between input variables and structured
                  output variables.  However, the memory demand of
                  GPstruct is quadratic in the number of latent
                  variables and training runtime scales cubically.
                  This prevents GPstruct from being applied to
                  problems involving grid factor graphs, which are
                  prevalent in computer vision and spatial statistics
                  applications.  Here we explore a scalable approach
                  to learning GPstruct models based on ensemble
                  learning, with weak learners (predictors) trained on

                  marginal optimisation methods in terms of predictive
                  performance and uncertainty calibration. Finally, it

  abstract =	 {In order to make predictions with high accuracy,
                  conventional deep learning systems require large
                  training datasets consisting of thousands or
                  millions of examples and long training times
                  measured in hours or days, consuming high levels of
                  electricity with a negative impact on our
                  environment. It is desirable to have have machine
                  learning systems that can emulate human behavior
                  such that they can quickly learn new concepts from
                  only a few examples. This is especially true if we
                  need to quickly customize or personalize machine
                  learning models to specific scenarios where it would
                  be impractical to acquire a large amount of training
                  data and where a mobile device is the means for
                  computation. We define a data efficient machine
                  learning system to be one that can learn a new
                  concept from only a few examples (or shots) and a
                  computation efficient machine learning system to be
                  one that can learn a new concept rapidly without
                  retraining on an everyday computing device such as a
                  smart phone. In this work, we design, develop,
                  analyze, and extend the theory of machine learning
                  systems that are both data efficient and computation
                  efficient. We present systems that are trained using
                  multiple tasks such that it "learns how to learn" to
                  solve new tasks from only a few examples. These
                  systems can efficiently solve new, unseen tasks
                  drawn from a broad range of data distributions, in
                  both the low and high data regimes, without the need
                  for costly retraining. Adapting to a new task
                  requires only a forward pass of the example task
                  data through the trained network making the learning
                  of new tasks possible on mobile devices. In
                  particular, we focus on few-shot image
                  classification systems, i.e. machine learning
                  systems that can distinguish between numerous
                  classes of objects depicted in digital images given
                  only a few examples of each class of object to learn
                  from.}

                  normalization an essential component of
                  meta-learning pipelines. However, the hierarchical
                  nature of the meta-learning setting presents several
                  challenges that can render conventional batch
                  normalization ineffective, giving rise to the need
                  to rethink normalization in this setting. We
                  evaluate a range of approaches to batch
                  normalization for meta-learning scenarios, and
                  develop a novel approach that we call
                  TASKNORM. Experiments on fourteen datasets
                  demonstrate that the choice of batch normalization
                  has a dramatic effect on both classification

                  and gradient free meta-learning
                  approaches. Importantly, TASKNORM is found to
                  consistently improve performance. Finally, we
                  provide a set of best practices for normalization

                  are computationally efficient at test time,
                  requiring just a few optimization steps or single
                  forward pass to learn a new task, but they remain
                  highly memory-intensive to train.  This limitation
                  arises because a task's entire support set, which
                  can contain up to 1000 images, must be processed
                  before an optimization step can be taken. Harnessing
                  the performance gains offered by large images thus
                  requires either parallelizing the meta-learner
                  across multiple GPUs, which may not be available, or
                  trade-offs between task and image size when memory
                  constraints apply. We improve on both options by
                  proposing LITE, a general and memory efficient
                  episodic training scheme that enables meta-training
                  on large tasks composed of large images on a single
                  GPU. We achieve this by observing that the gradients
                  for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients
                  over the task's training images. This enables us to
                  perform a forward pass on a task's entire training
                  set but realize significant memory savings by
                  back-propagating only a random subset of these
                  images which we show is an unbiased approximation of
                  the full gradient. We use LITE to train
                  meta-learners and demonstrate new state-of-the-art
                  accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of
                  the 4 parts of the challenging VTAB+ MD benchmark
                  relative to leading meta-learners.  LITE also
                  enables meta-learners to be competitive with
                  transfer learning approaches but at a fraction of
                  the test-time computational cost, thus serving as a
                  counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer
                  learning is all you need for few-shot
                  classification.}

                  desirable, for example, in spatio-temporal
                  modelling. The key problem with MOGPs is their
                  computational scaling $O(n^3 p^3)$, which is cubic
                  in the number of both inputs $n$ (e.g., time points
                  or locations) and outputs $p$. For this reason, a
                  popular class of MOGPs assumes that the data live
                  around a low-dimensional linear subspace, reducing
                  the complexity to $O(n^3 m^3)$. However, this cost
                  is still cubic in the dimensionality of the subspace
                  $m$, which is still prohibitively expensive for many
                  applications. We propose the use of a sufficient
                  statistic of the data to accelerate inference and
                  learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method
                  achieves linear scaling in $m$ in practice, allowing
                  these models to scale to large $m$ without
                  sacrificing significant expressivity or requiring
                  approximation. This advance opens up a wide range of
                  real-world tasks and can be combined with existing
                  GP approximations in a plug-and-play way. We
                  demonstrate the efficacy of the method on various
                  synthetic and real-world data sets.}

                  GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum:
                  it can only model smooth signals. Moreover,
                  inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a
                  mean-field assumption, resulting in poorly

                  variational optimisation of large covariance
                  matrices. We redesign the GPCM model to induce a
                  richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed
                  assumptions about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian
                  Process Convolution Model (CGPCM) introduces a
                  causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough
                  Gaussian Process Convolution Model (RGPCM) can be
                  interpreted as a Bayesian nonparametric
                  generalisation of the fractional Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck
                  process.  We also propose a more effective
                  variational inference scheme, going beyond the
                  mean-field assumption: we design a Gibbs sampler
                  which directly samples from the optimal variational
                  solution, circumventing any variational optimisation
                  entirely. The proposed variations of the GPCM are

                  with multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs
                  are nonparametric probabilistic models and as such
                  are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity
                  to generalise, and provide better calibrated
                  uncertainty estimates than alternative deep
                  models. This paper develops a new approximate

                  observed data. This idea sits at the heart of many
                  approximation schemes, but such an approach requires
                  the number of pseudo-datapoints to be scaled with
                  the range of the input space if the accuracy of the

                  paper we devise an approximation whose complexity
                  grows linearly with the number of
                  pseudo-datapoints. This is achieved by imposing a
                  tree or chain structure on the pseudo-datapoints and
                  calibrating the approximation using a
                  Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization. Inference and
                  learning can then be performed efficiently using the
                  Gaussian belief propagation algorithm. We
                  demonstrate the validity of our approach on a set of
                  challenging regression tasks including missing data
                  imputation for audio and spatial datasets. We trace
                  out the speed-accuracy trade-off for the new method
                  and show that the frontier dominates those obtained
                  from a large number of existing approximation
                  techniques.}

  abstract =	 {Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions
                  over functions that enable high-level assumptions
                  about unknown functions to be encoded in a
                  parsimonious, flexible and general way. Although
                  elegant, the application of GPs is limited by
                  computational and analytical intractabilities that
                  arise when data are sufficiently numerous or when
                  employing non-Gaussian models. Consequently, a
                  wealth of GP approximation schemes have been
                  developed over the last 15 years to address these
                  key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a
                  small set of pseudo data points to summarise the
                  actual data. In this paper we develop a new
                  pseudo-point approximation framework using Power
                  Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that unifies a
                  large number of these pseudo-point approximations.
                  Unlike much of the previous venerable work in this
                  area, the new framework is built on standard methods
                  for approximate inference (variational free-energy,
                  EP and Power EP methods) rather than employing
                  approximations to the probabilistic generative model
                  itself. In this way all of the approximation is
                  performed at `inference time' rather than at
                  `modelling time', resolving awkward philosophical
                  and empirical questions that trouble previous
                  approaches.  Crucially, we demonstrate that the new
                  framework includes new pseudo-point approximation
                  methods that outperform current approaches on
                  regression and classification tasks.}

  abstract =	 {Models with Gaussian process priors and Gaussian
                  likelihoods are one of only a handful of Bayesian
                  models where inference can be performed without the
                  need for approximation. However, a frequent
                  criticism of these models from practitioners of
                  Bayesian machine learning is that they are
                  challenging to scale to large datasets due to the
                  need to compute a large kernel matrix and perform
                  standard linear-algebraic operations with this
                  matrix. This limitation has driven decades of
                  research in both statistics and machine learning
                  seeking to scale Gaussian process regression models
                  to ever-larger datasets. This thesis builds on this
                  line of research. We focus on the problem of
                  approximate inference and model selection with
                  approximate maximum marginal likelihood as applied
                  to Gaussian process regression. Our discussion is
                  guided by three questions: Does an approximation
                  work on a range of models and datasets? Can you
                  verify that an approximation has worked on a given
                  dataset? Is an approximation easy for a practitioner
                  to use? While we are far from the first to ask these
                  questions, we offer new insights into each question
                  in the context of Gaussian process regression. In
                  the first part of this thesis, we focus on sparse
                  variational Gaussian process regression (Titsias,
                  2009). We provide new diagnostics for inference with
                  this method that can be used as practical guides for
                  practitioners trying to balance computation and
                  accuracy with this approximation. We then provide an
                  asymptotic analysis that highlights properties of
                  the model and dataset that are sufficient for this
                  approximation to perform reliable inference with a
                  small computational cost. This analysis builds on an
                  approach laid out in Burt (2018), as well as on
                  similar guarantees in the kernel ridge regression
                  literature. In the second part of this thesis, we
                  consider iterative methods, especially the method of
                  conjugate gradients, as applied to Gaussian process
                  regression (Gibbs and MacKay, 1997). We primarily
                  focus on improving the reliability of approximate
                  maximum marginal likelihood when using these
                  approximations. We investigate how the method of
                  conjugate gradients and related approaches can be
                  used to derive bounds on quantities related to the
                  log marginal likelihood. This idea can be used to
                  improve the speed and stability of model selection
                  with these approaches, making them easier to use in
                  practice.},

                  neural networks, where we only need the former, and
                  the latter is hard to represent. In this work, we
                  highlight some advantages and limitations of
                  employing the Kullback-Leibler divergence in this

                  benchmark for ‚Äòfunction-space‚Äô inference methods
                  that directly measures approximation quality. We
                  apply this methodology to assess aspects of the

                  in Sun et al. (2018), emphasizing the quality of
                  approximation to Bayesian inference as opposed to
                  predictive performance.}

                  often impeded for data with large numbers of
                  observations, N, due to the cubic (in N) cost of
                  matrix operations used in exact inference. Many
                  solutions have been proposed that rely on M << N

                  implications are still contested. Some have argued
                  that the disparities largely reflect differences in
                  drug use between racial groups, while others have
                  hypothesized that discriminatory enforcement
                  policies and police practices play a significant
                  role. In this work, we analyze racial disparities in
                  the enforcement of marijuana violations in the
                  US. Using data from the National Incident-Based
                  Reporting System (NIBRS) and the National Survey on
                  Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) programs, we investigate
                  whether marijuana usage and purchasing behaviors can
                  explain the racial composition of offenders in
                  police records. We examine potential driving
                  mechanisms behind these disparities and the extent
                  to which county-level socioeconomic factors are
                  associated with corresponding disparities. Our
                  results indicate that the significant racial
                  disparities in reported incidents and arrests cannot
                  be explained by differences in marijuana days-of-use
                  alone. Variations in the location where marijuana is
                  purchased and in the frequency of these purchases
                  partially explain the observed disparities. We
                  observe an increase in racial disparities across
                  most counties over the last decade, with the
                  greatest increases in states that legalized the use
                  of marijuana within this timeframe. Income, high
                  school graduation rate, and rate of employment
                  positively correlate with larger racial disparities,
                  while the rate of incarceration is negatively
                  correlated. We conclude with a discussion of the
                  implications of the observed racial disparities in

                  the learned policy serves as a proposal for MPC. We

                  utilise presupposed Lipschitz properties to compute
                  inferences over unobserved function values. Provided
                  a bound on the true best Lipschitz constant of the
                  target function is known a priori they offer
                  convergence guarantees as well as bounds around the
                  predictions. Considering a more general setting that
                  builds on H\"older continuity relative to
                  pseudo-metrics, we propose an online method for
                  estimating the Hoelder constant online from function
                  value observations that possibly are corrupted by
                  bounded observational errors. Utilising this to
                  compute adaptive parameters within a kinky inference
                  rule gives rise to a nonparametric machine learning
                  method, for which we establish strong universal
                  approximation guarantees. That is, we show that our
                  prediction rule can learn any continuous function in
                  the limit of increasingly dense data to within a
                  worst-case error bound that depends on the level of
                  observational uncertainty. We apply our method in
                  the context of nonparametric model-reference
                  adaptive control (MRAC). Across a range of simulated
                  aircraft roll-dynamics and performance metrics our
                  approach outperforms recently proposed alternatives
                  that were based on Gaussian processes and RBF-neural
                  networks. For discrete-time systems, we provide
                  stability guarantees for our learning-based
                  controllers both for the batch and the online
                  learning setting.}

                  approaches to nonparametric machine learning that
                  have been proposed to be utilised in the context of
                  system identification and learning-based
                  control. They utilise presupposed Lipschitz
                  properties in order to compute inferences over
                  unobserved function values. Unfortunately, most of
                  these approaches rely on exact knowledge about the
                  input space metric as well as about the Lipschitz
                  constant. Furthermore, existing techniques to
                  estimate the Lipschitz constants from the data are
                  not robust to noise or seem to be ad-hoc and
                  typically are decoupled from the ultimate learning
                  and prediction task. To overcome these limitations,
                  we propose an approach for optimising parameters of
                  the presupposed metrics by minimising validation set
                  prediction errors. To avoid poor performance due to
                  local minima, we propose to utilise Lipschitz
                  properties of the optimisation objective to ensure
                  global optimisation success. The resulting approach
                  is a new flexible method for nonparametric black-box
                  learning. We illustrate its competitiveness on a set
                  of benchmark problems.},

                  convergence to within an error which approaches zero
                  as the agents gain experience.  Our error bounds are
                  deterministic or probabilistic, depending on the
                  nature of the regret bounds available for the
                  algorithms employed by the agents.  We illustrate

                  structure of the function to be modeled. To model
                  complex and nondifferentiable functions, these
                  smoothness assumptions are often too
                  restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is
                  to find a different representation of the data by
                  introducing a feature space. This feature space is
                  often learned in an unsupervised way, which might
                  lead to data representations that are not useful for
                  the overall regression task. In this paper, we
                  propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel
                  supervised method that jointly learns a
                  transformation of the data into a feature space and
                  a GP regression from the feature space to observed
                  space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to
                  learn data representations, which are useful for the
                  overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we
                  evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth
                  functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as

                  can obscure the detection of neural activation using
                  fMRI, and it is therefore important to model and
                  remove the effects of this noise. While a
                  hemodynamic response function relating respiratory

                  described, no such mapping for heart rate (HR) has

                  federated learning (FL). In this work, we address
                  this issue with a novel client subsampling scheme,
                  where we restrict the number of clients allowed to
                  communicate their updates back to the master
                  node. In each communication round, all participating
                  clients compute their updates, but only the ones
                  with important updates communicate back to the
                  master. We show that importance can be measured
                  using only the norm of the update and give a formula
                  for optimal client participation.  This formula
                  minimizes the distance between the full update,
                  where all clients participate, and our limited
                  update, where the number of participating clients is
                  restricted. In addition, we provide a simple
                  algorithm that approximates the optimal formula for
                  client participation, which allows for secure
                  aggregation and stateless clients, and thus does not
                  compromise client privacy. We show both
                  theoretically and empirically that for Distributed

                  participating clients are sampled
                  uniformly. Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to
                  and compatible with existing methods for reducing

                  interest in embedding continuous time methods in
                  machine learning algorithms. In system
                  identification, the task is to learn a dynamical
                  model from incomplete observation data, and when
                  prior knowledge is in continuous time ‚Äì for example,
                  mechanistic differential equation models ‚Äì it seems
                  natural to use continuous time models for
                  learning. Yet when learning flexible, nonlinear,
                  probabilistic dynamics models, most previous work
                  has focused on discrete time models to avoid
                  computational, numerical, and mathematical
                  difficulties. In this work we show, with the aid of
                  small-scale examples, that this mismatch between
                  model and data generating process can be
                  consequential under certain circumstances, and we
                  discuss possible modifications to discrete time
                  models which may better suit them to handling data
                  generated by continuous time processes.}

                  meta-learning and conventional deep kernel

                  of movement activity. In fact, this relationship
                  accounted for preparatory responses better than did
                  traditional tuning models. These results are
                  expected if preparatory activity provides the
                  initial state of a dynamical system whose evolution
                  produces movement activity. Our results thus suggest
                  that preparatory activity may not represent specific

  abstract =	 {MOTIVATION: In clinical practice, pathological
                  phenotypes are often labelled with ordinal scales
                  rather than binary, e.g. the Gleason grading system
                  for tumour cell differentiation. However, in the
                  literature of microarray analysis, these ordinal
                  labels have been rarely treated in a principled
                  way. This paper describes a gene selection algorithm
                  based on Gaussian processes to discover consistent
                  gene expression patterns associated with ordinal
                  clinical phenotypes. The technique of automatic
                  relevance determination is applied to represent the
                  significance level of the genes in a Bayesian
                  inference framework.  RESULTS: The usefulness of the
                  proposed algorithm for ordinal labels is
                  demonstrated by the gene expression signature
                  associated with the Gleason score for prostate
                  cancer data. Our results demonstrate how multi-gene
                  markers that may be initially developed with a
                  diagnostic or prognostic application in mind are
                  also useful as an investigative tool to reveal
                  associations between specific molecular and cellular
                  events and features of tumour physiology. Our
                  algorithm can also be applied to microarray data
                  with binary labels with results comparable to other
                  methods in the literature.}

                  that evaluates the likelihood of two proteins

                  then used to infer a catalog of protein complexes
                  from the interaction screen data. An advantage of
                  this model is that it places no prior constraints on

                  variability can exist across trials. Many studies
                  have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean
                  response, but few have examined the effect on
                  response variability. We measured neural variability

  abstract =	 {Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) combine the
                  expressive power of deep learning with the
                  advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years,
                  the analysis of wide, deep BNNs has provided
                  theoretical insight into their priors and
                  posteriors. However, we have no analogous insight
                  into their posteriors under approximate
                  inference. In this work, we show that mean-field
                  variational inference <em>entirely fails to model
                  the data</em> when the network width is large and
                  the activation function is odd. Specifically, for
                  fully-connected BNNs with odd activation functions
                  and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show
                  that the <em>optimal</em> mean-field variational
                  posterior predictive (i.e., function space)
                  distribution converges to the prior predictive
                  distribution as the width tends to infinity. We
                  generalize aspects of this result to other
                  likelihoods. Our theoretical results are suggestive
                  of underfitting behavior previously observered in
                  BNNs. While our convergence bounds are
                  non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can be
                  computed, they are currently too loose to be
                  applicable in standard training regimes. Finally, we
                  show that the optimal approximate posterior need not
                  tend to the prior if the activation function is not
                  odd, showing that our statements cannot be
                  generalized arbitrarily.},

                  models are of paramount importance. Typically for ML
                  classification tasks, datasets contain hard labels,
                  yet learning using soft labels has been shown to
                  yield benefits for model generalization, robustness,
                  and calibration. Earlier work found success in
                  forming soft labels from multiple annotators' hard
                  labels; however, this approach may not converge to
                  the best labels and necessitates many annotators,
                  which can be expensive and inefficient. We focus on
                  efficiently eliciting soft labels from individual
                  annotators. We collect and release a dataset of soft
                  labels (which we call CIFAR-10S) over the CIFAR-10
                  test set via a crowdsourcing study (N=248). We

                  significant temporal costs per elicitation. Our

                  developed "offline", using neural activity
                  previously gathered from a healthy animal, and the
                  decoded movement is then compared with the true
                  movement that accompanied the recorded neural
                  activity. However, this offline design and testing
                  may neglect important features of a real prosthesis,
                  most notably the critical role of feedback control,
                  which enables the user to adjust neural activity
                  while using the prosthesis. We hypothesize that
                  under- standing and optimally designing
                  high-performance decoders require an experimental
                  platform where humans are in closed-loop with the
                  various candidate decode systems and algorithms. It
                  remains unexplored the extent to which the subject
                  can, for a particular decode system, algorithm, or
                  parameter, engage feedback and other strategies to
                  improve decode performance. Closed-loop testing may
                  suggest different choices than offline
                  analyses. Here we ask if a healthy human subject,
                  using a closed-loop neural prosthesis driven by
                  synthetic neural activity, can inform system
                  design. We use this online pros- thesis simulator
                  (OPS) to optimize "online" decode performance based
                  on a key parameter of a current state-of-the-art
                  decode algorithm, the bin width of a Kalman
                  filter. First, we show that offline and online
                  analyses indeed suggest different parameter
                  choices. Previous literature and our offline
                  analyses agree that neural activity should be
                  analyzed in bins of 100- to 300-ms width. OPS
                  analysis, which incorporates feedback control,
                  suggests that much shorter bin widths (25-50 ms)
                  yield higher decode performance. Second, we confirm
                  this surprising finding using a closed-loop rhesus
                  monkey prosthetic system. These findings illustrate
                  the type of discovery made possible by the OPS, and
                  so we hypothesize that this novel testing approach
                  will help in the design of prosthetic systems that
                  will translate well to human patients.}

                  randomness to estimate the value function. In this

                  Bayesian inference to large weight spaces often
                  requires restrictive approximations. In this work,
                  we show that it suffices to perform inference over a

                  accurate predictive posteriors. The other weights

                  inference framework enables us to use expressive,
                  otherwise intractable, posterior approximations over
                  such subsets.  In particular, we implement
                  subnetwork linearized Laplace: We first obtain a MAP

                  full-covariance Gaussian posterior over a

                  medical applications, we face decision-making
                  problems where data are limited and/or the
                  underlying generative process is complicated and
                  partially unknown. In these scenarios, we can profit
                  from algorithms that learn from data and aid
                  decision making.<br> Reinforcement learning (RL) is
                  a general computational approach to experience-based
                  goal-directed learning for sequential decision
                  making under uncertainty. However, RL often lacks
                  efficiency in terms of the number of required trials
                  when no task-specific knowledge is available. This
                  lack of efficiency makes RL often inapplicable to
                  (optimal) control problems. Thus, a central issue in
                  RL is to speed up learning by extracting more
                  information from available experience.<br> The
                  contributions of this dissertation are
                  threefold:<br> 1. We propose PILCO, a fully Bayesian
                  approach for efficient RL in continuous-valued state
                  and action spaces when no expert knowledge is
                  available. PILCO is based on well-established ideas
                  from statistics and machine learning. PILCO's key
                  ingredient is a probabilistic dynamics model learned
                  from data, which is implemented by a Gaussian
                  process (GP). The GP carefully quantifies knowledge
                  by a probability distribution over plausible
                  dynamics models. By averaging over all these models
                  during long-term planning and decision making, PILCO
                  takes uncertainties into account in a principled way
                  and, therefore, reduces model bias, a central
                  problem in model-based RL.<br> 2. Due to its
                  generality and efficiency, PILCO can be considered a
                  conceptual and practical approach to jointly
                  learning models and controllers when expert
                  knowledge is difficult to obtain or simply not
                  available. For this scenario, we investigate PILCO's
                  properties its applicability to challenging real and
                  simulated nonlinear control problems. For example,
                  we consider the tasks of learning to swing up a
                  double pendulum attached to a cart or to balance a
                  unicycle with five degrees of freedom. Across all
                  tasks we report unprecedented automation and an
                  unprecedented learning efficiency for solving these
                  tasks.<br> 3. As a step toward pilco's extension to
                  partially observable Markov decision processes, we
                  propose a principled algorithm for robust filtering
                  and smoothing in GP dynamic systems. Unlike commonly
                  used Gaussian filters for nonlinear systems, it does
                  neither rely on function linearization nor on
                  finite-sample representations of densities.  Our
                  algorithm profits from exact moment matching for
                  predictions while keeping all computations
                  analytically tractable. We present experimental
                  evidence that demonstrates the robustness and the
                  advantages of our method over unscented Kalman
                  filters, the cubature Kalman filter, and the
                  extended Kalman filter.}

                  in control and robotics for more than a decade since
                  data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of
                  engineering knowledge, which is otherwise
                  required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning
                  (RL) approaches typically require many interactions
                  with the system to learn controllers, which is a
                  practical limitation in real systems, such as
                  robots, where many interactions can be impractical
                  and time consuming. To address this problem, current
                  learning approaches typically require task-speciÔ¨Åc
                  knowledge in form of expert demonstrations,
                  realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or
                  speciÔ¨Åc knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In
                  this article, we follow a different approach and
                  speed up learning by extracting more information
                  from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic,
                  non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of
                  the system.  By explicitly incorporating model
                  uncertainty into long-term planning and controller
                  learning our approach reduces the effects of model
                  errors, a key problem in model-based
                  learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our
                  model-based policy search method achieves an
                  unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its
                  applicability to autonomous learning in real robot

                  progress in robust manipulation in unstructured
                  environments. The long-term goal of our work is to
                  get away from precise, but very expensive robotic
                  systems and to develop affordable, potentially
                  imprecise, self-adaptive manipulator systems that
                  can interactively perform tasks such as playing with
                  children. In this paper, we demonstrate how a
                  low-cost off-the-shelf robotic system can learn
                  closed-loop policies for a stacking task in only a
                  handful of trials - from scratch. Our manipulator is
                  inaccurate and provides no pose feedback. For
                  learning a controller in the work space of a
                  Kinect-style depth camera, we use a model-based
                  reinforcement learning technique. Our learning
                  method is data efficient, reduces model bias, and
                  deals with several noise sources in a principled way
                  during long-term planning. We present a way of
                  incorporating state-space constraints into the
                  learning process and analyze the learning gain by
                  exploiting the sequential structure of the stacking

                  learning (RL) framework with continuous state and
                  action spaces is challenging. Approximate solutions
                  are often inevitable. GPDP is an approximate dynamic
                  programming algorithm based on Gaussian process (GP)
                  models for the value functions.  In this paper, we
                  extend GPDP to the case of unknown transition

  abstract =	 {Reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control of
                  systems with continuous states and actions require
                  approximation techniques in most interesting
                  cases. In this article, we introduce Gaussian
                  process dynamic programming (GPDP), an approximate
                  value function-based RL algorithm. We consider both
                  a classic optimal control problem, where
                  problem-specific prior knowledge is available, and a
                  classic RL problem, where only very general priors
                  can be used. For the classic optimal control
                  problem, GPDP models the unknown value functions
                  with Gaussian processes and generalizes dynamic
                  programming to continuous-valued states and
                  actions. For the RL problem, GPDP starts from a
                  given initial state and explores the state space
                  using Bayesian active learning. To design a fast
                  learner, available data have to be used
                  efficiently. Hence, we propose to learn
                  probabilistic models of the a priori unknown
                  transition dynamics and the value functions on the
                  fly. In both cases, we successfully apply the
                  resulting continuous-valued controllers to the
                  under-actuated pendulum swing up and analyze the
                  performances of the suggested algorithms. It turns
                  out that GPDP uses data very efficiently and can be
                  applied to problems, where classic dynamic
                  programming would be cumbersome.},

                  hidden features from observations. In many
                  real-world situations, the number of hidden features
                  is unknown. To avoid specifying the number of hidden
                  features a priori, one can use the Indian Buffet
                  Process (IBP): a nonparametric latent feature model
                  that does not bound the number of active features in
                  a dataset. While elegant, the lack of efficient
                  inference procedures for the IBP has prevented its
                  application in large-scale problems.  The core
                  contribution of this thesis are three new inference
                  procedures that allow inference in the IBP to be
                  scaled from a few hundred to 100,000 observations.
                  This thesis contains three parts: (1) An
                  introduction to the IBP and a review of inference
                  techniques and extensions. The first chapters
                  summarise three constructions for the IBP and review
                  all currently published inference techniques.
                  Appendix C reviews extensions of the IBP to date.
                  (2) Novel techniques for scalable Bayesian
                  inference. This thesis presents three new inference
                  procedures: (a) an accelerated Gibbs sampler for
                  efficient Bayesian inference in a broad class of
                  conjugate models, (b) a parallel, asynchronous Gibbs
                  sampler that allows the accelerated Gibbs sampler to
                  be distributed across multiple processors, and (c) a
                  variational inference procedure for the IBP.  (3) A
                  framework for structured nonparametric latent
                  feature models.  We also present extensions to the
                  IBP to model more sophisticated relationships
                  between the co-occurring hidden features, providing
                  a general framework for correlated non-parametric
                  feature models.}

                  (POMDP) framework has proven useful in planning
                  domains where agents must balance actions that
                  provide knowledge and actions that provide
                  reward. Unfortunately, most POMDPs are complex
                  structures with a large number of parameters.  In
                  many real-world problems, both the structure and the
                  parameters are difficult to specify from domain
                  knowledge alone. Recent work in Bayesian
                  reinforcement learning has made headway in learning
                  POMDP models; however, this work has largely focused
                  on learning the parameters of the POMDP model. We
                  define an infinite POMDP (iPOMDP) model that does
                  not require knowledge of the size of the state
                  space; instead, it assumes that the number of
                  visited states will grow as the agent explores its
                  world and only models visited states explicitly. We
                  demonstrate the iPOMDP on several standard

                  novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between
                  multiple processors and uses message passing to
                  compute the global likelihoods and posteriors.  This
                  algorithm, the first parallel inference scheme for
                  IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of
                  magnitude larger than have previously been

  abstract =	 {Spoken language is one of the most intuitive forms
                  of interaction between humans and
                  agents. Unfortunately, agents that interact with
                  people using natural language often experience
                  communication errors and do not correctly understand
                  the user's intentions. Recent systems have
                  successfully used probabilistic models of speech,
                  language, and user behavior to generate robust
                  dialog performance in the presence of noisy speech
                  recognition and ambiguous language choices, but
                  decisions made using these probabilistic models are
                  still prone to errors due to the complexity of
                  acquiring and maintaining a complete model of human
                  language and behavior.  In this paper, we describe a
                  decision-theoretic model for human-robot interaction
                  using natural language. Our algorithm is based on
                  the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process
                  (POMDP), which allows agents to choose actions that
                  are robust not only to uncertainty from noisy or
                  ambiguous speech recognition but also unknown user
                  models. Like most dialog systems, a POMDP is defined
                  by a large number of parameters that may be
                  difficult to specify a priori from domain knowledge,
                  and learning these parameters from the user may
                  require an unacceptably long training period. We
                  describe an extension to the POMDP model that allows
                  the agent to acquire a linguistic model of the user
                  online, including new vocabulary and word choice
                  preferences.  Our approach not only avoids a
                  training period of constant questioning as the agent
                  learns, but also allows the agent to actively query
                  for additional information when its uncertainty
                  suggests a high risk of mistakes. We demonstrate our
                  approach both in simulation and on a natural
                  language interaction system for a robotic wheelchair
                  application.}

                  analysis of the interplay between activation

                  conditions imposed on the distribution are the
                  inputs of the model. CDE is a challenging task as
                  there is a fundamental trade-off between model
                  complexity, representational capacity and
                  overfitting. In this work, we propose to extend the

                  processes (GP) to map this augmented input onto
                  samples from the conditional distribution. Our
                  Bayesian approach allows for the modeling of small
                  datasets, but we also provide the machinery for it
                  to be applied to big data using stochastic
                  variational inference. Our approach can be used to
                  model densities even in sparse data regions, and
                  allows for sharing learned structure between
                  conditions. We illustrate the effectiveness and
                  wide-reaching applicability of our model on a

                  spatio-temporal density estimation of taxi

                  dimension.  The additional structure discoverable by
                  this model results in increased interpretability, as
                  well as state-of-the-art predictive power in

                  the deep Gaussian process, a type of

                  in standard architectures, the representational

                  degrees of freedom as the number of layers
                  increases, retaining only a single degree of freedom
                  in the limit. We propose an alternate network

                  leveraging data drawn from multiple related training
                  distributions or domains. To achieve this, DG is
                  commonly formulated as an average- or worst-case
                  problem over the set of possible domains. However,
                  predictors that perform well on average lack
                  robustness while predictors that perform well in the
                  worst case tend to be overly-conservative. To
                  address this, we propose a new probabilistic
                  framework for DG where the goal is to learn
                  predictors that perform well with high
                  probability. Our key idea is that distribution
                  shifts seen during training should inform us of
                  probable shifts at test time, which we realize by
                  explicitly relating training and test domains as
                  draws from the same underlying meta-distribution. To
                  achieve probable DG, we propose a new optimization
                  problem called Quantile Risk Minimization (QRM). By
                  minimizing the $\alpha$-quantile of predictor's risk
                  distribution over domains, QRM seeks predictors that
                  perform well with probability $\alpha$. To solve QRM
                  in practice, we propose the Empirical QRM (EQRM)
                  algorithm, and prove: (i) a generalization bound for
                  EQRM; and (ii) that EQRM recovers the causal
                  predictor as $\alpha$->1. In our experiments, we
                  introduce a more holistic quantile-focused
                  evaluation protocol for DG, and demonstrate that
                  EQRM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on

                  complex behavioral skills, but real-world
                  application of these methods requires a large amount
                  of experience to be collected by the agent. In
                  practical settings, such as robotics, this involves
                  repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the
                  environment between each attempt. However, not all
                  tasks are easily or automatically reversible. In
                  practice, this learning process requires extensive

  abstract =	 {In this paper, we investigate the question: Given a
                  small number of datapoints, for example N = 30, how
                  tight can PAC-Bayes and test set bounds be made? For
                  such small datasets, test set bounds adversely
                  affect generalisation performance by withholding
                  data from the training procedure.  In this setting,
                  PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to
                  their ability to use all the data to simultaneously
                  learn a posterior and bound its generalisation
                  risk. We focus on the case of i.i.d. data with a
                  bounded loss and consider the generic PAC-Bayes
                  theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is
                  known to recover many existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it
                  is unclear what the tightest bound derivable from
                  their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm
                  and dataset, we show that the tightest possible
                  bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;
                  and, in the more natural case of distributions over
                  datasets, we establish a lower bound on the best
                  bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this
                  lower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if
                  the posterior is equal to the prior. Moreover, to
                  illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study
                  synthetic one-dimensional classification tasks in
                  which it is feasible to meta-learn both the prior
                  and the form of the bound to numerically optimise
                  for the tightest bounds possible. We ind that in
                  this simple, controlled scenario, PAC-Bayes bounds
                  are competitive with comparable, commonly used
                  Chernoff test set bounds. However, the sharpest test
                  set bounds still lead to better guarantees on the
                  generalisation error than the PAC-Bayes bounds we
                  consider.}

                  component of many probabilistic models, such as
                  those for off-the-grid spatio-temporal data. They
                  enable the statistical symmetry of underlying
                  physical phenomena to be leveraged, thereby aiding
                  generalization. Prediction in such models can be
                  viewed as a translation equivariant map from
                  observed data sets to predictive SPs, emphasizing
                  the intimate relationship between stationarity and
                  equivariance. Building on this, we propose the
                  Convolutional Neural Process (ConvNP), which endows
                  Neural Processes (NPs) with translation equivariance
                  and extends convolutional conditional NPs to allow
                  for dependencies in the predictive distribution. The
                  latter enables ConvNPs to be deployed in settings
                  which require coherent samples, such as Thompson
                  sampling or conditional image completion. Moreover,
                  we propose a new maximum-likelihood objective to
                  replace the standard ELBO objective in NPs, which
                  conceptually simplifies the framework and
                  empirically improves performance. We demonstrate the
                  strong performance and generalization capabilities
                  of ConvNPs on 1D regression, image completion, and
                  various tasks with real-world spatio-temporal data.}

                  reliability and robustness in safety-critical
                  applications. While there have been many proposed
                  methods that either focus on distance-aware model
                  uncertainties for out-of-distribution detection or

                  fields as disparate as the social sciences, biology,
                  engineering or econometrics. In this dissertation,
                  we present a number of algorithms designed to learn
                  Bayesian nonparametric models of time series. The
                  goal of these kinds of models is twofold. First,
                  they aim at making predictions which quantify the
                  uncertainty due to limitations in the quantity and
                  the quality of the data. Second, they are flexible
                  enough to model highly complex data whilst
                  preventing overfitting when the data does not
                  warrant complex models.</br> We begin with a
                  unifying literature review on time series models
                  based on Gaussian processes. Then, we centre our
                  attention on the Gaussian Process State-Space Model
                  (GP-SSM): a Bayesian nonparametric generalisation of
                  discrete-time nonlinear state-space models. We
                  present a novel formulation of the GP-SSM that
                  offers new insights into its properties. We then
                  proceed to exploit those insights by developing new
                  learning algorithms for the GP-SSM based on particle
                  Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational
                  inference.</br> Finally, we present a filtered
                  nonlinear auto-regressive model with a simple,
                  robust and fast learning algorithm that makes it
                  well suited to its application by non-experts on
                  large datasets. Its main advantage is that it avoids
                  the computationally expensive (and potentially
                  difficult to tune) smoothing step that is a key part
                  of learning nonlinear state-space models.},

                  applications of machine learning. One of the main
                  difficulties with these vectors of categorical
                  variables is sparsity. The number of possible
                  observations grows exponentially with vector length,
                  but dataset diversity might be poor in
                  comparison. Recent models have gained significant
                  improvement in supervised tasks with this
                  data. These models embed observations in a
                  continuous space to capture similarities between
                  them. Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian
                  model for the unsupervised task of distribution
                  estimation of multivariate categorical data. We
                  model vectors of categorical variables as generated
                  from a non-linear transformation of a continuous
                  latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality
                  in the distribution. The continuous representation
                  addresses sparsity. Our model ties together many
                  existing models, linking the linear categorical
                  latent Gaussian model, the Gaussian process latent
                  variable model, and Gaussian process
                  classification. We derive inference for our model
                  based on recent developments in sampling based
                  variational inference. We show empirically that the
                  model outperforms its linear and discrete

                  faster experimentation cycles. In RL this allows the
                  agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as more
                  data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant
                  extensively on a range of tasks, and give insights

                  latent variable models that allows for an efficient
                  distributed algorithm. This is done by exploiting

                  complement traditional matched filtering techniques
                  that are used to detect the gravitational-wave
                  signature of merging black holes. However, to date,
                  these methods have not yet been successfully applied

                  by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave
                  observatories.  In this work, we critically examine
                  the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool
                  to search for merging black holes. We identify the
                  strengths and limitations of this approach,
                  highlight some common pitfalls in translating
                  between machine learning and gravitational-wave
                  astronomy, and discuss the interdisciplinary
                  challenges.  In particular, we explain in detail why
                  convolutional neural networks alone cannot be used
                  to claim a statistically significant
                  gravitational-wave detection.  However, we
                  demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly
                  flag the times of potential signals in the data for
                  a more detailed follow-up. Our convolutional neural
                  network architecture as well as the proposed
                  performance metrics are better suited for this task
                  than a standard binary classifications scheme. A
                  detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO
                  data demonstrates the potential of such systems as
                  trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note of
                  caution by constructing adversarial examples, which
                  showcase interesting "failure modes" of our model,
                  where inputs with no visible resemblance to real
                  gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by

                  and engineering. A model can be thought of as a
                  representation of possible data one could predict
                  from a system. The probabilistic approach to
                  modelling uses probability theory to express all
                  aspects of uncertainty in the model. The
                  probabilistic approach is synonymous with Bayesian
                  modelling, which simply uses the rules of
                  probability theory in order to make predictions,
                  compare alternative models, and learn model
                  parameters and structure from data. This simple and
                  elegant framework is most powerful when coupled with
                  flexible probabilistic models. Flexibility is
                  achieved through the use of Bayesian

                  Probabilistic modelling provides a framework for
                  understanding what learning is, and has therefore
                  emerged as one of the principal theoretical and
                  practical approaches for designing machines that
                  learn from data acquired through experience. The
                  probabilistic framework, which describes how to
                  represent and manipulate uncertainty about models
                  and predictions, has a central role in scientific
                  data analysis, machine learning, robotics, cognitive
                  science and artificial intelligence. This Review
                  provides an introduction to this framework, and
                  discusses some of the state-of-the-art advances in
                  the field, namely, probabilistic programming,
                  Bayesian optimization, data compression and

                  the exact E-step is computationally intractable. Two

                  determine the optimal number of components and the

                  number of factors in each factor

                  based on a probability distribution over equivalence
                  classes of binary matrices with a finite number of
                  rows, corresponding to the data points, and an
                  unbounded number of columns, corresponding to the
                  latent variables. Each data point can be associated
                  with a subset of the possible latent variables,
                  which we refer to as the latent features of that
                  data point. The binary variables in the matrix
                  indicate which latent feature is possessed by which
                  data point, and there is a potentially infinite
                  array of features. We derive the distribution over
                  unbounded binary matrices by taking the limit of a
                  distribution over N&times;K binary matrices as
                  K&rarr;&infin;. We define a simple generative
                  processes for this distribution which we call the
                  Indian buffet process (IBP; Griffiths and
                  Ghahramani, 2005, <a href="/pub/#GriGha06">2006</a>)
                  by analogy to the Chinese restaurant process
                  (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002). The IBP has a single
                  hyperparameter which controls both the number of
                  feature per ob ject and the total number of
                  features. We describe a two-parameter generalization
                  of the IBP which has additional flexibility,
                  independently controlling the number of features per
                  object and the total number of features in the
                  matrix. The use of this distribution as a prior in
                  an infinite latent feature model is illustrated, and
                  Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for inference

                  approximately linear dynamics and learns the
                  parameters of each of these linear regimes. This
                  model combines and generalizes two of the most
                  widely used stochastic time series models---hidden
                  Markov models and linear dynamical systems---and is
                  closely related to models that are widely used in
                  the control and econometrics literatures. It can
                  also be derived by extending the mixture of experts
                  neural network (Jacobs et al, 1991) to its fully
                  dynamical version, in which both expert and gating
                  networks are recurrent. Inferring the posterior
                  probabilities of the hidden states of this model is
                  computationally intractable, and therefore the exact
                  Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm cannot be
                  applied. However, we present a variational
                  approximation that maximizes a lower bound on the
                  log likelihood and makes use of both the
                  forward--backward recursions for hidden Markov
                  models and the Kalman filter recursions for linear
                  dynamical systems. We tested the algorithm both on

                  respiration force from a patient with sleep
                  apnea. The results suggest that variational

                  unsupervised learning is that learning will become
                  more difficult as the problem is scaled.  We examine
                  this issue in the context of a novel hierarchical,
                  generative model that can be viewed as a non-linear
                  generalization of factor analysis and can be
                  implemented in a neural network.  The model performs
                  perceptual inference in a probabilistically
                  consistent manner by using top-down, bottom-up and
                  lateral connections.  These connections can be
                  learned using simple rules that require only locally
                  available information.  We first demonstrate that
                  the model can extract a sparse, distributed,
                  hierarchical representation of global disparity from
                  simplified random-dot stereograms.  We then
                  investigate some of the scaling properties of the
                  algorithm on this problem and find that : (1)
                  increasing the image size leads to faster and more
                  reliable learning; (2) Increasing the depth of the
                  network from one to two hidden layers leads to
                  better representations at the first hidden layer,
                  and (3) Once one part of the network has discovered
                  how to represent disparity, it 'supervises' other
                  parts of the network, greatly speeding up their
                  learning.}

                  variables. It has been applied to system
                  identification in linear stochastic state-space
                  models, where the state variables are hidden from
                  the observer and both the state and the parameters
                  of the model have to be estimated simultaneously

                  for parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamical
                  systems. The ``expectation'' step makes use of
                  Extended Kalman Smoothing to estimate the state,
                  while the ``maximization'' step re-estimates the
                  parameters using these uncertain state estimates. In
                  general, the nonlinear maximization step is
                  difficult because it requires integrating out the
                  uncertainty in the states. However, if Gaussian
                  radial basis function (RBF) approximators are used
                  to model the nonlinearities, the integrals become
                  tractable and the maximization step can be solved
                  via systems of linear equations.  }

                  explored in human perceptual and motor learning. We
                  have chosen a coordinate transformation system---the
                  visuomotor map which transforms visual coordinates
                  into motor coordinates---to study the generalization
                  effects of learning new input--output pairs. Using a
                  paradigm of computer controlled altered visual
                  feedback, we have studied the generalization of the
                  visuomotor map subsequent to both local and
                  context-dependent remappings. A local remapping of
                  one or two input-output pairs induced a significant
                  global, yet decaying, change in the visuomotor map,
                  suggesting a representation for the map composed of
                  units with large functional receptive fields. Our
                  study of context-dependent remappings indicated that
                  a single point in visual space can be mapped to two
                  different finger locations depending on a context
                  variable---the starting point of the
                  movement. Furthermore, as the context is varied
                  there is a gradual shift between the two remappings,
                  consistent with two visuomotor modules being learned
                  and gated smoothly with the context.}

                  choice model describing how humans decide between
                  several options.  The options from which the choice
                  is made are characterized by binary features and
                  associated weights. For instance, when choosing
                  which mobile phone to buy the features to consider
                  may be: long lasting battery, color screen,
                  etc. Existing methods for inferring the parameters
                  of the model assume pre-specified features. However,
                  the features that lead to the observed choices are
                  not always known.  Here, we present a non-parametric
                  Bayesian model to infer the features of the options
                  and the corresponding weights from choice data. We
                  use the Indian buffet process (IBP) as a prior over
                  the features. Inference using Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo (MCMC) in conjugate IBP models has been
                  previously described. The main contribution of this
                  paper is an MCMC algorithm for the EBA model that
                  can also be used in inference for other
                  non-conjugate IBP models---this may broaden the use
                  of IBP priors considerably.},

                  explicitly restrict the number of

                  the problem of finding the "correct" number of

                  components. In this paper Dirichlet process mixture
                  (DPM) models are cast as infinite mixture models and
                  inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo is
                  described. The specification of the priors on the

                  conjugate and a conditionally conjugate base
                  distribution. We show that better density models can
                  result from using a wider class of priors with no or

                  scientific articles that satisfy biologists'
                  information needs. An emphasis is placed on
                  returning relevant passages that discuss different
                  aspects of the topic. Using an off-the-shelf
                  information retrieval (IR) engine, we focused on
                  query generation and reranking query results to
                  encourage relevance and diversity. For query
                  generation, we automatically identify noun phrases
                  from the topic descriptions, and use online
                  resources to gather synonyms as expansion terms. Our

                  initial ranking than our methods aimed specifically
                  at promoting diversity. While this sounds
                  discouraging, we have several ideas as to why this
                  happened and hope to produce new methods that

                  networks has received increasing attention. Despite
                  the capacity to overfit significantly, such large
                  models work better than smaller ones.  This
                  phenomenon is often referred to as the scaling law
                  by practitioners. It is of fundamental interest to
                  study why the scaling law exists and how it
                  avoids/controls overfitting. One approach has been
                  looking at infinite width limits of neural networks
                  (e.g., Neural Tangent Kernels, Gaussian Processes);
                  however, in practise, these do not fully explain
                  finite networks as their infinite counterparts do
                  not learn features.  Furthermore, the empirical
                  kernel for finite networks (i.e., the inner product
                  of feature vectors), changes significantly during
                  training in contrast to infinite width networks. In
                  this work we derive an iterative linearised training
                  method. We justify iterative lineralisation as an
                  interpolation between finite analogs of the infinite
                  width regime, which do not learn features, and
                  standard gradient descent training which does. We
                  show some preliminary results where iterative
                  linearised training works well, noting in particular
                  how much feature learning is required to achieve
                  comparable performance. We also provide novel
                  insights into the training behaviour of neural
                  networks.}

                  \Versa{}, an instance of the framework employing a
                  flexible and versatile amortization network that
                  takes few-shot learning datasets as inputs, with

                  distribution over task-specific parameters in a

  abstract =	 {As algorithms are increasingly used to make
                  important decisions that affect human lives, ranging
                  from social benefit assignment to predicting risk of
                  criminal recidivism, concerns have been raised about
                  the fairness of algorithmic decision making. Most
                  prior works on algorithmic fairness normatively
                  prescribe how fair decisions ought to be made. In
                  contrast, here, we descriptively survey users for
                  how they perceive and reason about fairness in
                  algorithmic decision making.  A key contribution of
                  this work is the framework we propose to understand
                  why people perceive certain features as fair or
                  unfair to be used in algorithms. Our framework
                  identifies eight properties of features, such as
                  relevance, volitionality and reliability, as latent
                  considerations that inform people‚Äôs moral judgments
                  about the fairness of feature use in decision-making
                  algorithms. We validate our framework through a
                  series of scenario-based surveys with 576 people. We
                  find that, based on a person‚Äôs assessment of the
                  eight latent properties of a feature in our exemplar
                  scenario, we can accurately (> 85%) predict if the
                  person will judge the use of the feature as fair.
                  Our findings have important implications. At a
                  high-level, we show that people‚Äôs unfairness
                  concerns are multi-dimensional and argue that future
                  studies need to address unfairness concerns beyond
                  discrimination. At a low-level, we find considerable
                  disagreements in people‚Äôs fairness judgments. We
                  identify root causes of the disagreements, and note
                  possible pathways to resolve them.  },

  abstract =	 {With wide-spread usage of machine learning methods
                  in numerous domains involving human subjects,
                  several studies have raised questions about the
                  potential for unfairness towards certain individuals
                  or groups. A number of recent works have proposed
                  methods to measure and eliminate unfairness from
                  machine learning methods. However, most of this work
                  on fair learning has focused on only one dimension
                  of fair decision making: distributive fairness,
                  i.e., the fairness of the decision outcomes. In this
                  work, we leverage the rich literature on
                  organizational justice and focus on another
                  dimension of fair decision making: procedural
                  fairness, i.e., the fairness of the decision making
                  process. We propose measures for procedural fairness
                  that consider the input features used in the
                  decision process, and evaluate the moral judgments
                  of humans regarding the use of these features. We
                  operationalize these measures on two real world
                  datasets using human surveys on the Amazon
                  Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform, demonstrating that
                  we capture important properties of procedurally fair
                  decision making. We provide fast submodular
                  mechanisms to optimize the tradeoff between
                  procedural fairness and prediction accuracy. On our
                  datasets, we observe empirically that procedural
                  fairness may be achieved with little cost to outcome
                  fairness, but that some loss of accuracy is
                  unavoidable.}

  abstract =	 {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering,
                  is a popular class of methods for sampling from an
                  intractable target distribution using a sequence of
                  simpler intermediate distributions. Like other
                  importance sampling-based methods, performance is
                  critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a
                  bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate
                  estimates of the target distribution. This paper
                  presents a new method for automatically adapting the
                  proposal using an approximation of the
                  Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true
                  posterior and the proposal distribution. The method
                  is very flexible, applicable to any parameterised
                  proposal distribution and it supports online and
                  batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt
                  powerful proposal distributions with rich
                  parameterisations based upon neural networks leading
                  to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo
                  (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC
                  significantly improves inference in a non-linear
                  state space model outperforming adaptive proposal
                  methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented
                  Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that
                  improved inference translates into improved
                  parameter learning when NASMC is used as a
                  subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis
                  Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to
                  train a neural network-based deep recurrent
                  generative model achieving results that compete with
                  the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music
                  modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap
                  between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in
                  scalable, black-box variational inference.}

                  as they assume rigid functional relationships for
                  the evolution of the variance. Moreover, functional
                  parameters are usually learned by maximum
                  likelihood, which can lead to overfitting. To
                  address these problems we introduce GP-Vol, a novel
                  non-parametric model for time-changing variances
                  based on Gaussian Processes. This new model can
                  capture highly flexible functional relationships for

                  online algorithm for fast inference in GP-Vol. This
                  method is much faster than current offline inference
                  procedures and it avoids overfitting problems by
                  following a fully Bayesian approach. Experiments

                  behavioral skills with minimal human
                  intervention. However, robotic applications of
                  reinforcement learning often compromise the autonomy
                  of the learning process in favor of achieving
                  training times that are practical for real physical
                  systems. This typically involves introducing
                  hand-engineered policy representations and
                  human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement
                  learning alleviates this limitation by training
                  general-purpose neural network policies, but
                  applications of direct deep reinforcement learning
                  algorithms have so far been restricted to simulated
                  settings and relatively simple tasks, due to their
                  apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we
                  demonstrate that a recent deep reinforcement
                  learning algorithm based on off-policy training of
                  deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D

                  algorithm across multiple robots which pool their
                  policy updates asynchronously. Our experimental
                  evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety
                  of 3D manipulation skills in simulation and a
                  complex door opening skill on real robots without

                  it possible to learn very complex

                  have been successful in a wide variety of simulated
                  domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep RL in
                  the real world is their high sample
                  complexity. Batch policy gradient methods offer
                  stable learning, but at the cost of high variance,
                  which often requires large batches. TD-style
                  methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and
                  Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased,
                  and often require costly hyperparameter sweeps to
                  stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods
                  that combine the stability of policy gradients with
                  the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present Q-Prop,
                  a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor
                  expansion of the off-policy critic as a control
                  variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable,
                  and effectively combines the benefits of on-policy
                  and off-policy methods. We analyze the connection
                  between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms,
                  and use control variate theory to derive two
                  variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive
                  adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop
                  provides substantial gains in sample efficiency over
                  trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with
                  generalized advantage estimation (GAE), and improves

                  methods using previously collected data can improve
                  sample efficiency over on-policy policy gradient
                  techniques. On the other hand, on-policy algorithms
                  are often more stable and easier to use. This paper
                  examines, both theoretically and empirically,
                  approaches to merging on- and off-policy updates for
                  deep reinforcement learning. Theoretical results
                  show that off-policy updates with a value function
                  estimator can be interpolated with on-policy policy
                  gradient updates whilst still satisfying performance
                  bounds. Our analysis uses control variate methods to
                  produce a family of policy gradient algorithms, with
                  several recently proposed algorithms being special
                  cases of this family. We then provide an empirical
                  comparison of these techniques with the remaining
                  algorithmic details fixed, and show how different
                  mixing of off-policy gradient estimates with
                  on-policy samples contribute to improvements in
                  empirical performance. The final algorithm provides
                  a generalization and unification of existing deep
                  policy gradient techniques, has theoretical
                  guarantees on the bias introduced by off-policy
                  updates, and improves on the state-of-the-art
                  model-free deep RL methods on a number of OpenAI Gym
                  continuous control benchmarks.}

  abstract =	 {Model-free reinforcement learning has been
                  successfully applied to a range of challenging
                  problems, and has recently been extended to handle
                  large neural network policies and value
                  functions. However, the sample complexity of
                  model-free algorithms, particularly when using
                  high-dimensional function approximators, tends to
                  limit their applicability to physical systems. In
                  this paper, we explore algorithms and
                  representations to reduce the sample complexity of
                  deep reinforcement learning for continuous control
                  tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for
                  improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First,
                  we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning
                  algorithm, which we call normalized adantage
                  functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more
                  commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic
                  methods. NAF representation allows us to apply
                  Q-learning with experience replay to continuous
                  tasks, and substantially improves performance on a
                  set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further
                  improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore
                  the use of learned models for accelerating
                  model-free reinforcement learning. We show that
                  iteratively refitted local linear models are
                  especially effective for this, and demonstrate
                  substantially faster learning on domains where such
                  models are applicable.}

                  resides. However, a single data set may be

                  we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric Bayesian
                  model that can discover several possible clustering

                  only to learn the multiple clusterings and views but
                  also allows us to automatically learn the number of

                  introduced and compared to Bayesian
                  regularization. We show that pruning arises
                  naturally within both adaptive regularization
                  schemes. As model example we have chosen the
                  simplest possible: estimating the mean of a random
                  variable with known variance. Marked similarities
                  are found between the two methods in that they both
                  involve a "noise limit", below which they regularize
                  with infinite weight decay, i.e., they

                  it belonging to any of the existing clusters in the

                  on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance
                  metric. (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to
                  decide which merges are advantageous and to output
                  the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm

                  image retrieval which models the distribution of
                  color and texture features within sets of related
                  images. Given a userspecified text query
                  (e.g. "penguins") the system first extracts a set of
                  images, from a labelled corpus, corresponding to
                  that query. The distribution over features of these
                  images is used to compute a Bayesian score for each
                  image in a large unlabelled corpus. Unlabelled
                  images are then ranked using this score and the top
                  images are returned. Although the Bayesian score is
                  based on computing marginal likelihoods, which
                  integrate over model parameters, in the case of
                  sparse binary data the score reduces to a single
                  matrix-vector multiplication and is therefore
                  extremely efficient to compute. We show that our
                  method works surprisingly well despite its
                  simplicity and the fact that no relevance feedback
                  is used. We compare different choices of features,
                  and evaluate our results using human subjects.}

  abstract =	 {Although clustering data into mutually exclusive
                  partitions has been an extremely successful approach
                  to unsupervised learning, there are many situations
                  in which a richer model is needed to fully represent
                  the data. This is the case in problems where data
                  points actually simultaneously belong to multiple,
                  overlapping clusters. For example a particular gene
                  may have several functions, therefore belonging to
                  several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist
                  may want to discover these through unsupervised
                  modeling of gene expression data. We present a new
                  nonparametric Bayesian method, the Infinite
                  Overlapping Mixture Model (IOMM), for modeling
                  overlapping clusters. The IOMM uses exponential
                  family distributions to model each cluster and forms
                  an overlapping mixture by taking products of such
                  distributions, much like products of experts
                  (Hinton, 2002). The IOMM allows an unbounded number
                  of clusters, and assignments of points to (multiple)
                  clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet Process
                  (IBP), (Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM
                  has the desirable properties of being able to focus
                  in on overlapping regions while maintaining the
                  ability to model a potentially infinite number of
                  clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC inference
                  algorithms for the IOMM and show that these can be
                  used to cluster movies into multiple genres.}

                  assumes that each data point belongs to one and only
                  one mixture component, or cluster, a partial
                  membership model allows data points to have

                  clusters. Algorithms which assign data points
                  partial memberships to clusters can be useful for
                  tasks such as clustering genes based on microarray
                  data (Gasch \& Eisen, 2002). Our Bayesian Partial
                  Membership Model (BPM) uses exponential family
                  distributions to model each cluster, and a product
                  of these distibtutions, with weighted parameters, to
                  model each datapoint. Here the weights correspond to
                  the degree to which the datapoint belongs to each

                  so we can use Hybrid Monte Carlo to perform

                  between the BPM and Latent Dirichlet Allocation,
                  Mixed Membership models, Exponential Family PCA, and
                  fuzzy clustering. Lastly, we show some experimental

                  research effort has been made into attacking three
                  issues with GP models: how to compute efficiently
                  when the number of data is large; how to approximate
                  the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian
                  and how to estimate covariance function parameter
                  posteriors. This paper simultaneously addresses
                  these, using a variational approximation to the
                  posterior which is sparse in support of the function
                  but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid

                  approximate alternative. Because the process of
                  estimating feature selection dependencies may suffer
                  from over-fitting in the model proposed, additional
                  data from a multi-task learning scenario are
                  considered for induction. The same model can be used
                  in this setting with few modifications. Furthermore,
                  the assumptions made are less restrictive than in
                  other multi-task methods: The different tasks must

                  selection in linear regression problems.  The method
                  is based on a generalized version of the standard
                  spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often
                  used for individual feature selection. Exact
                  {B}ayesian inference under the prior considered is
                  infeasible for typical regression problems. However,
                  approximate inference can be carried out efficiently
                  using {E}xpectation {P}ropagation (EP). A detailed
                  analysis of the generalized spike-and-slab prior
                  shows that it is well suited for regression problems
                  that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore,
                  this prior can be used to introduce prior knowledge
                  about specific groups of features that are a priori
                  believed to be more relevant. An experimental
                  evaluation compares the performance of the proposed
                  method with those of group {LASSO}, {B}ayesian group
                  {LASSO}, automatic relevance determination and
                  additional variants used for group feature
                  selection.  The results of these experiments show
                  that a model based on the generalized spike-and-slab

                  useful to carry out sequential experimental design
                  (also known as active learning), where the data
                  instances that are most informative are iteratively
                  included in the training set, reducing the number of

                  wide variety of contexts.  To model them,
                  probabilistic matrix factorization (PMF) methods are
                  an attractive solution. However, current batch
                  algorithms for PMF can be inefficient because they
                  need to analyze the entire data matrix before
                  producing any parameter updates. We derive an
                  efficient stochastic inference algorithm for PMF
                  models of fully observed binary matrices. Our method
                  exhibits faster convergence rates than more
                  expensive batch approaches and has better predictive
                  performance than scalable alternatives. The proposed
                  method includes new data subsampling strategies
                  which produce large gains over standard uniform
                  subsampling. We also address the task of
                  automatically selecting the size of the minibatches
                  of data used by our method. For this, we derive an

                  express these dependencies in terms of a copula
                  function. Typically the copula function is assumed

                  the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related

                  black-box optimization problems. Several methods
                  have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian
                  optimization with constraints, based on the expected
                  improvement (EI) heuristic. However, EI can lead to
                  pathologies when used with constraints. For example,
                  in the case of decoupled constraints‚Äîi.e., when one
                  can independently evaluate the objective or the
                  constraints‚ÄîEI can encounter a pathology that
                  prevents exploration. Additionally, computing EI
                  requires a current best solution, which may not
                  exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy
                  the constraints. By contrast, information-based
                  approaches do not suffer from these failure
                  modes. In this paper, we present a new
                  information-based method called Predictive Entropy
                  Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the

                  benchmark problems, as well as several real-world

                  The Bayesian approach places emphasis on detailed

                  with new users or items for which one has little or

                  the performance of active learning depends strongly
                  upon having accurate estimates of i) the uncertainty
                  in model parameters and ii) the intrinsic noisiness

                  tractable. However, for other tasks and with more
                  complex models, such as classification with
                  nonparametric models, the optimal solution is harder
                  to compute. Current approaches make approximations
                  to achieve tractability. We propose an approach that
                  expresses information gain in terms of predictive
                  entropies, and apply this method to the Gaussian
                  Process Classifier (GPC). Our approach makes minimal
                  approximations to the full information theoretic
                  objective. Our experimental performance compares
                  favourably to many popular active learning
                  algorithms, and has equal or lower computational
                  complexity. We compare well to decision theoretic
                  approaches also, which are privy to more information
                  and require much more computational time. Secondly,
                  by developing further a reformulation of binary
                  preference learning to a classification problem, we
                  extend our algorithm to Gaussian Process preference
                  learning.  }

  abstract =	 { Humans develop rich mental representations that
                  guide their behavior in a variety of every-day
                  tasks.  However, it is unknown whether these
                  representations, often formalized as priors in
                  Bayesian inference, are specific for each task or
                  subserve multiple tasks. Current approaches cannot
                  distinguish between these two possibilities because
                  they cannot extract comparable representations
                  across different tasks.  Here, we develop a novel
                  method, termed cognitive tomography, that can
                  extract complex, multi-dimensional priors across
                  tasks. We apply this method to human judgments in
                  two qualitatively different tasks, familiarity and
                  odd-one-out, involving an ecologically relevant set
                  of stimuli, human faces. We show that priors over
                  faces are structurally complex and vary dramatically
                  across subjects, but are invariant across the tasks
                  within each subject. The priors we extract from each
                  task allow us to predict with high precision the
                  behavior of subjects for novel stimuli both in the
                  same task as well as in the other task.  Our results
                  provide the first evidence for a single
                  high-dimensional structured representation of a
                  naturalistic stimulus set that guides behavior in
                  multiple tasks. Moreover, the representations
                  estimated by cognitive tomography can provide
                  independent, behavior-based regressors for
                  elucidating the neural correlates of complex
                  naturalistic priors. }

                  industry due to their scalability and
                  maintainability. These systems produce
                  recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple
                  nominators preselect a small number of items from a
                  large pool using cheap-to-compute item embeddings;
                  (ii) with a richer set of features, a ranker
                  rearranges the nominated items and serves them to
                  the user. A key challenge of this setup is that
                  optimal performance of each stage in isolation does
                  not imply optimal global performance. In response to
                  this issue, Ma et al. (2020) proposed a nominator
                  training objective importance weighted by the
                  ranker's probability of recommending each item. In
                  this work, we focus on the complementary issue of
                  exploration. Modeled as a contextual bandit problem,
                  we find LinUCB (a near optimal exploration strategy
                  for single-stage systems) may lead to linear regret
                  when deployed in two-stage recommenders. We
                  therefore propose a method of synchronising the
                  exploration strategies between the ranker and the
                  nominators. Our algorithm only relies on quantities
                  already computed by standard LinUCB at each stage
                  and can be implemented in three lines of additional
                  code. We end by demonstrating the effectiveness of
                  our algorithm experimentally.  }

                  platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and
                  Pinterest. These systems produce recommendations in
                  two steps: (i) multiple nominators, tuned for low
                  prediction latency, preselect a small subset of
                  candidates from the whole item pool; (ii) a slower
                  but more accurate ranker further narrows down the
                  nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite
                  their popularity, the literature on two-stage
                  recommenders is relatively scarce, and the
                  algorithms are often treated as mere sums of their
                  parts. Such treatment presupposes that the two-stage
                  performance is explained by the behavior of the
                  individual components in isolation. This is not the
                  case: using synthetic and real-world data, we
                  demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and
                  the nominators substantially affect the overall
                  performance. Motivated by these findings, we derive
                  a generalization lower bound which shows that
                  independent nominator training can lead to
                  performance on par with uniformly random
                  recommendations. We find that careful design of item
                  pools, each assigned to a different nominator,
                  alleviates these issues. As manual search for a good
                  pool allocation is difficult, we propose to learn
                  one instead using a Mixture-of-Experts based
                  approach. This significantly improves both precision
                  and recall at K.  }

                  by developers on online platforms. To maximize
                  exposure, many creators adapt strategically, as
                  evidenced by examples like the sprawling search
                  engine optimization industry. This begets
                  competition for the finite user attention pool. We
                  formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure
                  game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms
                  including modern factorization and (deep) two-tower
                  architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous
                  algorithmic choices‚Äîe.g., non-negative
                  vs. unconstrained factorization‚Äîsignificantly affect
                  the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in

                  models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment

                  complement post-hoc measures like content filtering
                  and moderation. To this end, we propose tools for
                  numerically finding equilibria in exposure games,
                  and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens
                  and LastFM datasets. Among else, we find that the

                  dependence between algorithmic exploration and
                  content diversity, and between model expressivity

                  inference algorithm for Bayesian neural
                  networks. The main contribution of the
                  reinterpretation is in providing a theoretical
                  framework useful for analysing and extending the
                  algorithm. We show that the proposed framework
                  suffers from several issues; from undefined or
                  pathological behaviour of the true posterior related
                  to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined
                  variational objective due to singularity of the
                  approximating distribution relative to the true
                  posterior. Our analysis of the improper log uniform
                  prior used in variational Gaussian dropout suggests
                  the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that
                  the algorithm still works only because the
                  variational formulation annuls some of the
                  pathologies. To address the singularity issue, we
                  proffer Quasi-KL (QKL) divergence, a new approximate
                  inference objective for approximation of
                  high-dimensional distributions. We show that
                  motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based
                  on discretisation and noise have QKL as a limit.
                  Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically and
                  on a simple practical example which shows that the
                  QKL-optimal approximation of a full rank Gaussian
                  with a degenerate one naturally leads to the

                  'representative' small subgraph from the original
                  large graph, with 'representative' describing the
                  requirement that the sample shall preserve crucial
                  graph properties of the original graph. In our
                  experiments, we improve over the pioneering work of
                  Leskovec and Faloutsos (KDD 2006), by producing
                  representative subgraph samples that are both
                  smaller and of higher quality than those produced by
                  other methods from the literature.}

                  achieves performance superior to any other weighted

                  typically relies on sampling or other

                  methodology for constructing novel tractable
                  nonparametric Bayesian methods by applying the
                  kernel trick to inference in a parametric Bayesian
                  model. For example, Gaussian process regression can
                  be derived this way from Bayesian linear
                  regression. Despite the success of the Gaussian
                  process framework, the kernel trick is rarely
                  explicitly considered in the Bayesian literature. In
                  this paper, we aim to fill this gap and demonstrate
                  the potential of applying the kernel trick to
                  tractable Bayesian parametric models in a wider
                  context than just regression. As an example, we
                  present an intuitive Bayesian kernel machine for
                  density estimation that is obtained by applying the
                  kernel trick to a Gaussian generative model in

                  subject's minds. In order to eliminate potential
                  biases in reporting mental contents due to verbal
                  elaboration, subjects' responses in experiments are
                  often limited to binary decisions or discrete
                  choices that do not require conscious reflection
                  upon their mental contents. However, it is unclear

                  potential richness and dynamics of subjects' mental
                  representations. To address this problem, we used
                  ideal observer models that formalise choice

                  representations in long-term memory, acquired

  abstract =	 {Dynamical systems are a powerful formalism to
                  analyse the world around us. Many datasets are
                  sequential in nature, and can be described by a
                  discrete time evolution law. We are interested in
                  approaching the analysis of such datasets from a
                  probabilistic perspective. We would like to maintain
                  justified beliefs about quantities which, though
                  useful in explaining the behaviour of a system, may
                  not be observable, as well as about the system's
                  evolution itself, especially in regimes we have not
                  yet observed in our data. The framework of
                  statistical inference gives us the tools to do so,
                  yet, for many systems of interest, performing
                  inference exactly is not computationally or
                  analytically tractable. The contribution of this
                  thesis, then, is twofold: first, we uncover two
                  sources of bias in existing variational inference
                  methods applied to dynamical systems in general, and
                  state space models whose transition function is
                  drawn from a Gaussian process (GPSSM) in
                  particular. We show bias can derive from assuming
                  posteriors in non-linear systems to be jointly
                  Gaussian, and from assuming that we can sever the
                  dependence between latent states and transition
                  function in state space model posteriors. Second, we
                  propose methods to address these issues, undoing the
                  resulting biases. We do this without compromising on
                  computational efficiency or on the ability to scale
                  to larger datasets and higher dimensions, compared
                  to the methods we rectify. One method, the Markov
                  Autoregressive Flow (Markov AF) addresses the
                  Gaussian assumption, by providing a more flexible
                  class of posteriors, based on normalizing flows,
                  which can be easily evaluated, sampled, and
                  optimised. The other method, Variationally Coupled
                  Dynamics and Trajectories (VCDT), tackles the
                  factorisation assumption, leveraging sparse Gaussian
                  processes and their variational representation to
                  reintroduce dependence between latent states and the
                  transition function at no extra computational
                  cost. Since the objective of inference is to
                  maintain calibrated beliefs, if we employed
                  approximations which are significantly biased in
                  non-linear, noisy systems, or when there is little
                  data available, we would have failed in our
                  objective, as those are precisely the regimes in
                  which uncertainty quantification is all the more
                  important. Hence we think it is essential, if we
                  wish to act optimally on such beliefs, to uncover,
                  and, if possible, to correct, all sources of
                  systematic bias in our inference methods.}

                  of the variational posterior.  As we demonstrate in
                  our experiments, the factorisation between latent

                  nodes in different networks. For example, the
                  proposed method can discover shared word groups from
                  multi-lingual document-word networks without
                  cross-language alignment information. We assume that
                  multiple networks share groups, and each group has
                  its own interaction pattern with other groups. Using
                  infinite relational models with this assumption,
                  objects in different networks are clustered into
                  common groups depending on their interaction
                  patterns, discovering a matching. The effectiveness
                  of the proposed method is experimentally
                  demonstrated by using synthetic and real relational
                  data sets, which include applications to
                  cross-domain recommendation without shared user/item
                  identifiers and multi-lingual word clustering.},

  abstract =	 {Many people share their activities with others
                  through online communities. These shared activities
                  have an impact on other users' activities. For
                  example, users are likely to become interested in
                  items that are adopted (e.g. liked, bought and
                  shared) by their friends. In this paper, we propose
                  a probabilistic model for discovering latent
                  influence from sequences of item adoption events. An
                  inhomogeneous Poisson process is used for modeling a
                  sequence, in which adoption by a user triggers the
                  subsequent adoption of the same item by other
                  users. For modeling adoption of multiple items, we
                  employ multiple inhomogeneous Poisson processes,
                  which share parameters, such as influence for each
                  user and relations between users. The proposed model
                  can be used for finding influential users,
                  discovering relations between users and predicting
                  item popularity in the future. We present an
                  efficient Bayesian inference procedure of the
                  proposed model based on the stochastic EM
                  algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model
                  is demonstrated by using real data sets in a social

                  information originally learned from data, as well as
                  sample diversity. An RNN is first pre-trained on

                  the probability distribution over the next token in

                  unknown. In this work, we first show that it is
                  impossible to guarantee recourse without access to
                  the true structural equations. To address this
                  limitation, we propose two probabilistic approaches
                  to select optimal actions that achieve recourse with
                  high probability given limited causal knowledge
                  (e.g., only the causal graph). The first captures
                  uncertainty over structural equations under additive
                  Gaussian noise, and uses Bayesian model averaging to
                  estimate the counterfactual distribution. The second
                  removes any assumptions on the structural equations
                  by instead computing the average effect of recourse
                  actions on individuals similar to the person who
                  seeks recourse, leading to a novel
                  subpopulation-based interventional notion of
                  recourse. We then derive a gradient-based procedure
                  for selecting optimal recourse actions, and
                  empirically show that the proposed approaches lead
                  to more reliable recommendations under imperfect
                  causal knowledge than non-probabilistic baselines.},

  abstract =	 {BACKGROUND: Modern DNA sequencing methods produce
                  vast amounts of data that often requires mapping to
                  a reference genome. Most existing programs use the
                  number of mismatches between the read and the genome
                  as a measure of quality. This approach is without a
                  statistical foundation and can for some data types
                  result in many wrongly mapped reads. Here we present
                  a probabilistic mapping method based on
                  position-specific scoring matrices, which can take
                  into account not only the quality scores of the
                  reads but also user-specified models of evolution
                  and data-specific biases.RESULTS:We show how
                  evolution, data-specific biases, and sequencing
                  errors are naturally dealt with
                  probabilistically. Our method achieves better
                  results than Bowtie and BWA on simulated and real
                  ancient and PAR-CLIP reads, as well as on simulated
                  reads from the AT rich organism P. falciparum, when
                  modeling the biases of these data. For simulated
                  Illumina reads, the method has consistently higher
                  sensitivity for both single-end and paired-end
                  data. We also show that our probabilistic approach
                  can limit the problem of random matches from short
                  reads of contamination and that it improves the
                  mapping of real reads from one organism
                  (D.~melanogaster) to a related genome
                  (D.~simulans). CONCLUSION: The presented work is an
                  implementation of a novel approach to short read
                  mapping where quality scores, prior mismatch
                  probabilities and mapping qualities are handled in a
                  statistically sound manner. The resulting
                  implementation provides not only a tool for
                  biologists working with low quality and/or biased
                  sequencing data but also a demonstration of the
                  feasibility of using a probability based alignment
                  method on real and simulated data sets.},

                  network science, where the aim is to reach the
                  maximum possible number of nodes, while only
                  targeting a small initial set of individuals. It has
                  critical applications in many fields, including
                  viral marketing, information propagation, news
                  dissemination, and vaccinations. However, the
                  objective does not usually take into account whether
                  the final set of influenced nodes is fair with
                  respect to sensitive attributes, such as race or
                  gender. Here we address fair influence maximization,
                  aiming to reach minorities more equitably. We
                  introduce Adversarial Graph Embeddings: we co-train
                  an auto-encoder for graph embedding and a
                  discriminator to discern sensitive attributes. This
                  leads to embeddings which are similarly distributed
                  across sensitive attributes. We then find a good
                  initial set by clustering the embeddings. We believe
                  we are the first to use embeddings for the task of
                  fair influence maximization. While there are
                  typically trade-offs between fairness and influence
                  maximization objectives, our experiments on
                  synthetic and real-world datasets show that our
                  approach dramatically reduces disparity while
                  remaining competitive with state-of-the-art
                  influence maximization methods.}

  abstract =	 {Causal approaches to fairness have seen substantial
                  recent interest, both from the machine learning
                  community and from wider parties interested in
                  ethical prediction algorithms. In no small part,
                  this has been due to the fact that causal models
                  allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert
                  knowledge to remove discriminatory effects from
                  predictions. However, one of the primary assumptions
                  in causal modeling is that you know the causal
                  graph. This introduces a new opportunity for bias,
                  caused by misspecifying the causal model. One common
                  way for misspecification to occur is via unmeasured
                  confounding: the true causal effect between
                  variables is partially described by unobserved
                  quantities. In this work we design tools to assess
                  the sensitivity of fairness measures to this
                  confounding for the popular class of non-linear
                  additive noise models (ANMs). Specifically, we give
                  a procedure for computing the maximum difference
                  between two counterfactually fair predictors, where
                  one has become biased due to confounding. For the
                  case of bivariate confounding our technique can be
                  swiftly computed via a sequence of closed-form
                  updates. For multivariate confounding we give an
                  algorithm that can be efficiently solved via
                  automatic differentiation. We demonstrate our new
                  sensitivity analysis tools in real-world fairness
                  scenarios to assess the bias arising from
                  confounding.}

                  predictive models requires access to ground truth
                  labels. Unfortunately, in practice, labels may only
                  exist conditional on certain decisions‚Äîif a loan is

                  approach exposes previously ignored subtleties and
                  why they are fundamental to the problem. Finally, we
                  put forward natural causal non-discrimination
                  criteria and develop algorithms that satisfy them.}

                  over the latent function. Based on this work, we
                  present an approximate EM algorithm, the EM-EP
                  algorithm, to learn both the latent function and the
                  hyperparameters. This algorithm is found to converge
                  in practice and provides an efficient Bayesian
                  framework for learning hyperparameters of the
                  kernel. A multiclass extension of the EM-EP
                  algorithm for GPCs is also derived. In the
                  experimental results, the EM-EP algorithms are as
                  good or better than other methods for GPCs or
                  Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with
                  cross-validation.}

                  probabilistic predictions of multiple models, each
                  weighted by its posterior probability. This is the
                  coherent Bayesian way of combining multiple models
                  only under certain restrictive assumptions, which we
                  outline. We explore a general framework for Bayesian
                  model combination (which differs from model
                  averaging) in the context of classification. This
                  framework explicitly models the relationship between
                  each model‚Äôs output and the unknown true label. The
                  framework does not require that the models be
                  probabilistic (they can even be human assessors),
                  that they share prior information or receive the
                  same training data, or that they be independent in
                  their errors. Finally, the Bayesian combiner does
                  not need to believe any of the models is in fact
                  correct. We test several variants of this classifier
                  combination procedure starting from a classic
                  statistical model proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979)
                  and using MCMC to add more complex but important
                  features to the model. Comparisons on sev- eral data
                  sets to simpler methods like majority voting show
                  that the Bayesian methods not only perform well but
                  result in interpretable diagnostics on the data

                  technologies generate a broad array of different
                  data types, providing distinct-but often
                  complementary-information. We present a Bayesian
                  method for the unsupervised integrative modelling of
                  multiple datasets, which we refer to as MDI
                  (Multiple Dataset Integration). MDI can integrate
                  information from a wide range of different datasets
                  and data types simultaneously (including the ability
                  to model time series data explicitly using Gaussian
                  processes). Each dataset is modelled using a
                  Dirichlet-multinomial allocation (DMA) mixture
                  model, with dependencies between these models
                  captured through parameters that describe the
                  agreement among the datasets.  RESULTS: Using a set
                  of six artificially constructed time series
                  datasets, we show that MDI is able to integrate a
                  significant number of datasets simultaneously, and
                  that it successfully captures the underlying
                  structural similarity between the datasets. We also
                  analyse a variety of real Saccharomyces cerevisiae

                  MDI's performance is comparable with the present
                  state-of-the-art. We then move beyond the

                  accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes) have become widely
                  available due to their small size and low
                  cost. Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at
                  high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain
                  position and orientation information. These
                  estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but
                  suffer from integration drift over longer time
                  scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are
                  typically combined with additional sensors and
                  models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal
                  processing aspects of position and orientation

                  different modeling choices and a selected number of

  abstract =	 {We point out an instantiation of Simpson's paradox
                  in COVID-19 case fatality rates (cfrs): comparing a
                  large-scale study from China (February 17) with
                  early reports from Italy (March 9), we find that
                  cfrs are lower in Italy for every age group, but
                  higher overall. This phenomenon is explained by a
                  stark difference in case demographic between the two
                  countries. Using this as a motivating example, we
                  introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and
                  show how these can be used to quantify different
                  direct and indirect effects when assuming a
                  coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age,
                  and case fatality. We curate an age-stratified cfr
                  dataset with >750 k cases and conduct a case study,
                  investigating total, direct, and indirect
                  (age-mediated) causal effects between different
                  countries and at different points in time. This
                  allows us to separate age-related effects from
                  others unrelated to age and facilitates a more
                  transparent comparison of cfrs across countries at
                  different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Using
                  longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign
                  reversal of the direct causal effect in mid-March,
                  which temporally aligns with the reported collapse
                  of the healthcare system in parts of the
                  country. Moreover, we find that direct and indirect
                  effects across 132 pairs of countries are only
                  weakly correlated, suggesting that a country's
                  policy and case demographic may be largely
                  unrelated. We point out limitations and extensions
                  for future work, and finally, discuss the role of
                  causal reasoning in the broader context of using AI
                  to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.},

                  also to learn from unlabelled data, that is,
                  combining adaptation with semi-supervised
                  learning. Using ideas from causality, we argue that
                  this requires learning with both causes, $X_C$, and
                  effects, $X_E$, of a target variable, $Y$, and show

                  predicting it from its effects. Since both these

                  way with recombinable components is a pre-requisite
                  for higher-order reasoning and acting in the
                  physical world. However, current generative models
                  lack the ability to capture the inherently
                  compositional and layered nature of visual
                  scenes. While recent work has made progress towards
                  unsupervised learning of object-based scene
                  representations, most models still maintain a global
                  representation space (i.e., objects are not
                  explicitly separated), and cannot generate scenes
                  with novel object arrangement and depth
                  ordering. Here, we present an alternative approach
                  which uses an inductive bias encouraging modularity
                  by training an ensemble of generative models
                  (experts). During training, experts compete for
                  explaining parts of a scene, and thus specialise on
                  different object classes, with objects being
                  identified as parts that re-occur across multiple
                  scenes. Our model allows for controllable sampling
                  of individual objects and recombination of experts
                  in physically plausible ways. In contrast to other
                  methods, depth layering and occlusion are handled
                  correctly, moving this approach closer to a causal
                  generative scene model. Experiments on simple toy
                  data qualitatively demonstrate the conceptual
                  advantages of the proposed approach.},

  abstract =	 {Self-supervised representation learning has shown
                  remarkable success in a number of domains. A common
                  practice is to perform data augmentation via
                  hand-crafted transformations intended to leave the
                  semantics of the data invariant. We seek to
                  understand the empirical success of this approach
                  from a theoretical perspective.  We formulate the
                  augmentation process as a latent variable model by
                  postulating a partition of the latent representation
                  into a content component, which is assumed invariant
                  to augmentation, and a style component, which is
                  allowed to change.  Unlike prior work on
                  disentanglement and independent component analysis,
                  we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal
                  dependencies in the latent space.  We study the
                  identifiability of the latent representation based
                  on pairs of views of the observations and prove
                  sufficient conditions that allow us to identify the
                  invariant content partition up to an invertible
                  mapping in both generative and discriminative
                  settings. We find numerical simulations with
                  dependent latent variables are consistent with our
                  theory. Lastly, we introduce Causal3DIdent, a
                  dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images
                  with rich causal dependencies, which we use to study
                  the effect of data augmentations performed in

                  explicitly account for causal relationships between
                  features, thereby capturing downstream effects of
                  recourse actions performed in the physical world. We
                  explore how our criteria relate to others, such as
                  counterfactual fairness, and show that fairness of

                  of the posterior, ignoring the decision task -- and
                  associated losses -- for which the posterior could
                  be used. We argue that this can be suboptimal and
                  propose instead to \emph{loss-calibrate} the
                  approximate inference methods with respect to the
                  decision task at hand. We present a general
                  framework rooted in Bayesian decision theory to
                  analyze approximate inference from the perspective
                  of losses, opening up several research
                  directions. As a first loss-calibrated approximate
                  inference attempt, we propose an EM-like algorithm
                  on the Bayesian posterior risk and show how it can
                  improve a standard approach to Gaussian process
                  classification when losses are asymmetric.}

                  information. Tools for automatically aligning these
                  knowledge bases would make it possible to unify many
                  sources of structured knowledge and answer complex
                  queries. However, the efficient alignment of
                  large-scale knowledge bases still poses a
                  considerable challenge. Here, we present Simple
                  Greedy Matching (SiGMa), a simple algorithm for
                  aligning knowledge bases with millions of entities
                  and facts. SiGMa is an iterative propagation
                  algorithm which leverages both the structural
                  information from the relationship graph as well as
                  flexible similarity measures between entity
                  properties in a greedy local search, thus making it
                  scalable. Despite its greedy nature, our experiments
                  indicate that SiGMa can efficiently match some of
                  the world's largest knowledge bases with high
                  precision. We provide additional experiments on
                  benchmark datasets which demonstrate that SiGMa can
                  outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in
                  accuracy and efficiency.}

                  central model selection choice in a Gaussian process
                  [Rasmussen and Williams, 2006]. Typically, the
                  hyperparameters of the kernel are chosen by
                  maximising the marginal likelihood, an approach
                  known as Type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II).
                  However, ML-II does not account for hyperparameter
                  uncertainty, and it is well-known that this can lead
                  to severely biased estimates and an underestimation
                  of predictive uncertainty. While there are several
                  works which employ a fully Bayesian characterisation
                  of GPs, relatively few propose such approaches for
                  the sparse GPs paradigm. In this work we propose an
                  algorithm for sparse Gaussian process regression
                  which leverages MCMC to sample from the
                  hyperparameter posterior within the variational
                  inducing point framework of [Titsias, 2009]. This
                  work is closely related to Hensman et al. [2015b],
                  but side-steps the need to sample the inducing
                  points, thereby significantly improving sampling
                  efficiency in the Gaussian likelihood case. We
                  compare this scheme against natural baselines in
                  literature along with stochastic variational GPs
                  (SVGPs) along with an extensive computational
                  analysis.}

                  (HMC) yielding a sampling based approximation and 2)

                  an unsupervised learning context. The Bayesian

                  270 million people and countless ecosystems.
                  However, precipitation, a key component to
                  hydrological modelling, is poorly understood in this
                  area. A key challenge surrounding this uncertainty
                  comes from the complex spatial-temporal distribution
                  of precipitation across the basin. In this work we
                  propose Gaussian processes with structured
                  non-stationary kernels to model precipitation
                  patterns in the UIB. Previous attempts to quantify
                  or model precipitation in the Hindu Kush Karakoram
                  Himalayan region have often been qualitative or
                  include crude assumptions and simplifications which
                  cannot be resolved at lower resolutions.  This body
                  of research also provides little to no error
                  propagation. We account for the spatial variation in
                  precipitation with a non-stationary Gibbs kernel
                  parameterised with an input dependent
                  lengthscale. This allows the posterior function
                  samples to adapt to the varying precipitation
                  patterns inherent in the distinct underlying
                  topography of the Indus region. The input dependent
                  lengthscale is governed by a latent Gaussian process
                  with a stationary squared-exponential kernel to
                  allow the function level hyperparameters to vary
                  smoothly.  In ablation experiments we motivate each
                  component of the proposed kernel by demonstrating
                  its ability to model the spatial covariance,
                  temporal structure and joint spatio-temporal
                  reconstruction. We benchmark our model with a
                  stationary Gaussian process and a Deep Gaussian
                  processes.}

                  system of complex socioeconomic, climatological, and
                  ecological interactions. The numerous objectives of
                  the UN‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and
                  the Paris Agreement have various levels of
                  interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain
                  the influence of changes to particular indicators
                  across the whole system. In this analysis, we aimed
                  to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between
                  objectives of sustainability agendas.  Methods: We
                  developed a method to find interlinkages among the
                  17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and
                  non-monotonic dependences. We used time series of
                  indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting of
                  400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17
                  SDGs and an 18th variable (annual average
                  temperatures), representing progress in the response
                  to the climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This
                  method detects significant dependencies among the
                  time evolution of the objectives by using partial
                  distance correlations, a non-linear measure of
                  conditional dependence that also discounts spurious
                  correlations originating from lurking variables. We
                  then used a network representation to identify the
                  most important objectives (using network centrality)
                  and to obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as
                  highly interconnected clusters in the network).
                  Findings: Using temporal data from 181 countries
                  spanning 20 years, we analysed dependencies among
                  SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based on
                  region, development, and income level. The observed
                  significant interlinkages, central objectives, and
                  nexuses identified varied greatly across country
                  groupings; however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the
                  goals) and climate change ranked as highly important
                  across many country groupings. Temperature rise was
                  strongly linked to urbanisation, air pollution, and
                  slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country
                  groupings likely to be worst affected by climate
                  breakdown, such as Africa. In several country
                  groupings composed of developing nations, we
                  observed a consistent nexus of strongly
                  interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty
                  reduction), SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic
                  growth), sometimes incorporating SDG 5 (gender
                  equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice).
                  Interpretation: The differences across groupings
                  emphasise the need to define goals in accordance
                  with local circumstances and priorities. Our
                  analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG 17) as
                  a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have
                  been strongly linked to economic growth (SDG
                  8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion
                  were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal
                  of development, our analysis showed that education
                  (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more
                  central, thus suggesting that these could be
                  prioritised in global partnerships. Urban
                  livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important
                  to avoid replicating unsustainable patterns of the
                  past.},

                  would reverse the perceived rhythm pattern (i.e.,
                  trochaic -> iambic) whereas a 2\pi radian shift
                  (full cycle) would retain the perceived rhythm
                  pattern (i.e., trochaic -> trochaic). The results
                  confirmed these predictions. Listeners judgments of
                  rhythm systematically followed Stress-Syllable AM
                  phase-shifts, but were unaffected by phase-shifts
                  between the Syllable AM and the Sub-beat AM (~14‚ÄâHz)
                  in a control condition. It is concluded that the
                  Stress-Syllable AM phase relationship is an
                  envelope-based modulation statistic that supports
                  speech rhythm perception.},

                  how can we do so with a mathematically tractable
                  model that allows for rigorous analysis of network
                  properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of
                  surprising properties: Heavy tails for the in- and
                  out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the
                  eigenvalues and eigenvectors, small diameters, and
                  densification and shrinking diameters over
                  time. Current network models and generators either
                  fail to match several of the above properties, are
                  complicated to analyze mathematically, or both. Here
                  we propose a generative model for networks that is
                  both mathematically tractable and can generate
                  networks that have all the above mentioned
                  structural properties. Our main idea here is to use
                  a non-standard matrix operation, the Kronecker
                  product, to generate graphs which we refer to as
                  "Kronecker graphs".<br>First, we show that Kronecker
                  graphs naturally obey common network properties. In
                  fact, we rigorously prove that they do so. We also
                  provide empirical evidence showing that Kronecker
                  graphs can effectively model the structure of real
                  networks.<br>We then present KRONFIT, a fast and
                  scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker graph
                  generation model to large real networks. A naive
                  approach to fitting would take super-exponential
                  time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by
                  exploiting the structure of Kronecker matrix
                  multiplication and by using statistical simulation
                  techniques.  Experiments on a wide range of large
                  real and synthetic networks show that KRONFIT finds
                  accurate parameters that very well mimic the
                  properties of target networks. In fact, using just
                  four parameters we can accurately model several
                  aspects of global network structure. Once fitted,
                  the model parameters can be used to gain insights
                  about the network structure, and the resulting
                  synthetic graphs can be used for null-models,
                  anonymization, extrapolations, and graph
                  summarization.}

                  can decrease the uncertainty associated with an

                  approximation algorithm that is often used to
                  perform approximate Bayesian parameter learning. EP
                  approximates the full intractable posterior
                  distribution through a set of local-approximations
                  that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP
                  can offer analytic and computational advantages over
                  other approximations, such as Variational Inference
                  (VI), and is the method of choice for a number of
                  models. The local nature of EP appears to make it an
                  ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on
                  large models in large-scale datasets
                  settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in
                  this context: the number approximating factors needs
                  to increase with the number of data-points, N, which
                  often entails a prohibitively large memory
                  overhead. This paper presents an extension to EP,
                  called stochastic expectation propagation (SEP),
                  that maintains a global posterior approximation
                  (like VI) but updates it in a local way (like EP
                  ). Experiments on a number of canonical learning
                  problems using synthetic and real-world datasets
                  indicate that SEP performs almost as well as full
                  EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor
                  of N. SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing
                  approximate Bayesian learning in the large model,
                  large dataset setting.}

                  applications. Yet vanilla Transformers are
                  notoriously resource-expensive, requiring O(L2) in
                  serial time and memory as functions of input length
                  L. Recent works proposed various linear
                  self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as O(L) for
                  serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis
                  of recent Transformer mechanisms with linear
                  self-attention, Performers, in terms of overall
                  computational complexity. We observe a remarkable
                  computational flexibility: forward and backward
                  propagation can be performed with no approximations
                  using sublinear memory as a function of L (in
                  addition to negligible storage for the input
                  sequence), at a cost of greater time complexity in
                  the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a
                  Performer consumes only O(1) memory during training,
                  and still requires O(L) time. This discovered

                  maps. We present variants of CRTs where RFs are
                  positive, a key requirement for applications in
                  recent low-rank Transformers. Further variance
                  reduction is possible by leveraging statistics which
                  are simple to compute. One instantiation of CRTs,

                  ABLO has many applications across deep learning, it
                  suffers from time and memory complexity proportional
                  to the length $r$ of its inner optimization loop. To
                  address this complexity, an earlier first-order
                  method (FOM) was proposed as a heuristic which omits
                  second derivative terms, yielding significant speed

                  demonstrate convergence bounds, and find an optimal

  abstract =	 {This thesis makes contributions to a variety of
                  aspects of probabilistic inference. When performing
                  probabilistic inference, one must first represent
                  one‚Äôs beliefs with a probability
                  distribution. Specifying the details of a
                  probability distribution can be a difficult task in
                  many situations, but when expressing beliefs about
                  complex data structures it may not even be apparent
                  what form such a distribution should take. This
                  thesis starts by demonstrating how representation
                  theorems due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg can be
                  used to specify appropriate models for data in the
                  form of networks. These theorems are then extended
                  in order to reveal appropriate probability
                  distributions for arbitrary relational data or
                  databases.  A simpler data structure to specify
                  probability distributions for is that of functions;
                  many probability distributions for functions have
                  been used for centuries. We demonstrate that many of
                  these distributions can be expressed in a common
                  language of Gaussian process kernels constructed
                  from a few base elements and operators. The
                  structure of this language allows for the effective
                  automatic construction of probabilistic models for
                  functions. Furthermore, the formal mathematical
                  language of kernels can be mapped neatly onto
                  natural language allowing for automatic descriptions
                  of the automatically constructed models.  By further
                  automating the construction of statistical models,
                  the need to be able to effectively check or
                  criticise these models becomes greater. This thesis
                  demonstrates how kernel two sample tests can be used
                  to demonstrate where a probabilistic model most
                  disagrees with data allowing for targeted
                  improvements to the model. In proposing a new method
                  of model criticism this thesis also briefly
                  discusses the philosophy of model criticism within
                  the context of probabilistic inference.},

                  consequences.  First, Gaussian processes can model
                  functions in terms of high-level properties
                  (e.g. smoothness, trends, periodicity,
                  changepoints). Taken together with the compositional
                  structure of our language of models this allows us
                  to automatically describe functions in simple
                  terms. Second, the use of flexible nonparametric
                  models and a rich language for composing them in an
                  open-ended manner also results in state-of-the-art

                  model criticism using maximum mean discrepancy (MMD)
                  two sample tests. Typical approaches to model
                  criticism require a practitioner to select a
                  statistic by which to measure discrepancies between
                  data and a statistical model. MMD two sample tests
                  are instead constructed as an analytic maximisation
                  over a large space of possible statistics and
                  therefore automatically select the statistic which
                  most shows any discrepancy. We demonstrate on

  abstract =	 {A fundamental problem in the analysis of structured
                  relational data like graphs, networks, databases,
                  and matrices is to extract a summary of the common
                  structure underlying relations between individual
                  entities.  Relational data are typically encoded in
                  the form of arrays; invariance to the ordering of
                  rows and columns corresponds to exchangeable arrays.
                  Results in probability theory due to Aldous, Hoover
                  and Kallenberg show that exchangeable arrays can be
                  represented in terms of a random measurable function
                  which constitutes the natural model parameter in a
                  Bayesian model.  We obtain a flexible yet simple
                  Bayesian nonparametric model by placing a Gaussian
                  process prior on the parameter function.  Efficient
                  inference utilises elliptical slice sampling
                  combined with a random sparse approximation to the
                  Gaussian process.  We demonstrate applications of
                  the model to network data and clarify its relation

  abstract =	 {Bayesian statistical models allow us to formalise
                  our knowledge about the world and reason about our
                  uncertainty, but there is a need for better
                  procedures to accurately encode its complexity. One
                  way to do so is through compositional models, which
                  are formed by combining blocks consisting of simpler
                  models. One can increase the complexity of the
                  compositional model by either stacking more blocks
                  or by using a not-so-simple model as a building
                  block. This thesis is an example of the latter. One
                  first aim is to expand the choice of Bayesian
                  nonparametric (BNP) blocks for constructing
                  tractable compositional models. So far, most of the
                  models that have a Bayesian nonparametric component
                  use a Dirichlet Process or a Pitman-Yor process
                  because of the availability of tractable and compact
                  representations. This thesis shows how to overcome
                  certain intractabilities in order to obtain
                  analogous compact representations for the class of
                  Poisson-Kingman priors which includes the Dirichlet
                  and Pitman-Yor processes.  A major impediment to the
                  widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric building
                  blocks is that inference is often costly,
                  intractable or difficult to carry out. This is an
                  active research area since dealing with the model's
                  infinite dimensional component forbids the direct
                  use of standard simulation-based methods. The main
                  contribution of this thesis is a variety of
                  inference schemes that tackle this problem: Markov
                  chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo
                  methods, which are exact inference schemes since
                  they target the true posterior. The contributions of
                  this thesis, in a larger context, provide general
                  purpose exact inference schemes in the flavour or
                  probabilistic programming: the user is able to
                  choose from a variety of models, focusing only on
                  the modelling part. Indeed, if the wide enough class
                  of Poisson-Kingman priors is used as one of our
                  blocks, this objective is achieved.}

                  consistent Monte Carlo estimators for Gram matrices:
                  matrices of kernel values between pairs of

                  a set of full rankings consistent with an observed
                  partial ranking. They form a computationally

                  objects are present in the image, and the other how
                  they are ordered in depth. This depth order then
                  determines how the positions and appearances of the

                  combine to form the image. We show that the object
                  parameters can be learnt from an unlabelled set of
                  images in which objects occlude one another. Exact
                  maximum-likelihood learning is intractable. However,

                  access these population processes empirically by
                  fitting statistical models to unaveraged data. What
                  statistical structure best describes the concurrent
                  spiking of cells within a local network? We argue
                  that in the cortex, where firing exhibits extensive
                  correlations in both time and space and where a
                  typical sample of neurons still reflects only a very
                  small fraction of the local population, the most
                  appropriate model captures shared variability by a
                  low-dimensional latent process evolving with smooth
                  dynamics, rather than by putative direct
                  coupling. We test this claim by comparing a latent
                  dynamical model with realistic spiking observations
                  to coupled generalised linear spike-response models
                  (GLMs) using cortical recordings. We find that the
                  latent dynamical approach outperforms the GLM in
                  terms of goodness-of- fit, and reproduces the
                  temporal correlations in the data more
                  accurately. We also compare models whose
                  observations models are either derived from a
                  Gaussian or point-process models, finding that the
                  non-Gaussian model provides slightly better
                  goodness-of-fit and more realistic population spike
                  counts.}

                  can be easy when the past trajectory continues
                  smoothly but is challenging when complex
                  interactions with other agents are involved. Recent
                  deep learning approaches for trajectory prediction
                  show promising performance and partially attribute
                  this to successful reasoning about agent-agent
                  interactions.  However, it remains unclear which
                  features such black-box models actually learn to use
                  for making predictions. This paper proposes a
                  procedure that quantifies the contributions of
                  different cues to model performance based on a
                  variant of Shapley values. Applying this procedure
                  to state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on
                  standard benchmark datasets shows that they are, in
                  fact, unable to reason about interactions. Instead,
                  the past trajectory of the target is the only
                  feature used for predicting its future. For a task
                  with richer social interaction patterns, on the
                  other hand, the tested models do pick up such
                  interactions to a certain extent, as quantified by
                  our feature attribution method. We discuss the
                  limits of the proposed method and its links to

                  of amortized optimization, optimizing network
                  parameters rather than the policy distributions

                  off-the-grid and missing data. CNPs scale to large
                  datasets and train with ease. Due to these features,
                  CNPs appear well-suited to tasks from environmental
                  sciences or healthcare. Unfortunately, CNPs do not
                  produce correlated predictions, making them
                  fundamentally inappropriate for many estimation and
                  decision making tasks. Predicting heat waves or
                  floods, for example, requires modelling dependencies
                  in temperature or precipitation over time and space.
                  Existing approaches which model output dependencies,
                  such as Neural Processes (NPs; Garnelo et al.,
                  2018b) or the FullConvGNP (Bruinsma et al., 2021),
                  are either complicated to train or prohibitively
                  expensive. What is needed is an approach which
                  provides dependent predictions, but is simple to
                  train and computationally tractable. In this work,
                  we present a new class of Neural Process models that
                  make correlated predictions and support exact
                  maximum likelihood training that is simple and

                  invertible output transformations, to capture
                  non-Gaussian output distributions. Our models can be
                  used in downstream estimation tasks which require
                  dependent function samples. By accounting for output
                  dependencies, our models show improved predictive

                  be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined
                  Kullback-Leibler divergence between the

                  models which have an extremely high intrinsic
                  capacity. The results obtained are often i
                  nitialization dependent, are different for disparate
                  optimizers and in some cases have no explicit
                  regularization. This raises difficult questions
                  about generalization. A natural approach to
                  questions of generalization is a Bayesian one. There
                  is therefore a growing literature attempting to
                  understand how Bayesian posterior inference could
                  emerge from the complexity of modern practice, even
                  without having such a procedure as the stated goal.
                  In this work we consider a simple special case where
                  exact Bayesian posterior sampling emerges from
                  sampling (cf initialization) and then gradient
                  descent.  Specifically, for a Bayesian linear model,
                  if we parameterize it in terms of a deterministic
                  function of an isotropic normal prior, then the
                  action of sampling from the prior followed by first
                  order optimization of the squared loss will give a
                  posterior sample. Although the assumptions are
                  stronger than many real problems, it still exhibits
                  the challenging properties of redundant model
                  capacity and a lack of explicit regularizers, along
                  with initialization and optimizer dependence. It is
                  therefore an interesting controlled test case. Given
                  its simplicity, the method itself may turn out to be
                  of independent interest from our original goal.  }

                  efficient learning critically requires probabilistic
                  modelling of dynamics. Traditional control
                  approaches use deterministic models, which easily
                  overfit data, especially small datasets. We use
                  probabilistic Bayesian modelling to learn systems
                  from scratch, similar to the PILCO algorithm, which
                  achieved unprecedented data efficiency in learning
                  control of several benchmarks. We extend PILCO in
                  three principle ways. First, we learn control under
                  significant observation noise by simulating a
                  filtered control process using a tractably analytic
                  framework of Gaussian distributions. In addition, we
                  develop the `latent variable belief Markov decision
                  process' when filters must predict under real-time
                  constraints. Second, we improve PILCO's data
                  efficiency by directing exploration with predictive
                  loss uncertainty and Bayesian optimisation,
                  including a novel approximation to the Gittins
                  index. Third, we take a step towards data efficient
                  learning of high-dimensional control using Bayesian
                  neural networks (BNN). Experimentally we show
                  although filtering mitigates adverse effects of
                  observation noise, much greater performance is
                  achieved when optimising controllers with
                  evaluations faithful to reality: by simulating
                  closed-loop filtered control if executing
                  closed-loop filtered control. Thus, controllers are
                  optimised w.r.t. how they are used, outperforming
                  filters applied to systems optimised by unfiltered
                  simulations. We show directed exploration improves
                  data efficiency. Lastly, we show BNN dynamics models
                  are almost as data efficient as Gaussian process
                  models. Results show data efficient learning of
                  high-dimensional control is possible as BNNs scale
                  to high-dimensional state inputs.}

                  composed of a pipeline of individual components,
                  linking sensor inputs to motor outputs. Erroneous
                  component outputs propagate downstream, hence safe
                  AV software must consider the ultimate effect of
                  each component's errors. Further, improving safety
                  alone is not sufficient. Passengers must also feel
                  safe to trust and use AV systems. To address such
                  concerns, we investigate three under-explored themes
                  for AV research: safety, interpretability, and
                  compliance. Safety can be improved by quantifying
                  the uncertainties of component outputs and
                  propagating them forward through the pipeline.
                  Interpretability is concerned with explaining what
                  the AV observes and why it makes the decisions it
                  does, building reassurance with the passenger.
                  Compliance refers to maintaining some control for
                  the passenger. We discuss open challenges for
                  research within these themes. We highlight the need
                  for concrete evaluation metrics, propose example
                  problems, and highlight possible solutions.}

                  solutions under small noise exist, such as PILCO
                  which learns the cartpole swing-up task in 30s.
                  PILCO evaluates policies by planning
                  state-trajectories using a dynamics model. However,
                  PILCO applies policies to the observed state,
                  therefore planning in observation space. We extend

                  space, consistent with partially observable Markov

  abstract =	 {In many scientific disciplines it is often required
                  to make predictions about how a system will behave
                  or to deduce the correct control values to elicit a
                  particular desired response. Efficiently solving
                  both of these tasks relies on the construction of a
                  model capturing the system's operation. In the most
                  interesting situations, the model needs to capture
                  strongly nonlinear effects and deal with the
                  presence of uncertainty and noise. Building models
                  for such systems purely based on a theoretical
                  understanding of underlying physical principles can
                  be infeasibly complex and require a large number of
                  simplifying assumptions. An alternative is to use a
                  data-driven approach, which builds a model directly
                  from observations. A powerful and principled
                  approach to doing this is to use a Gaussian Process
                  (GP).<br> In this thesis we start by discussing how
                  GPs can be applied to data sets which have noise
                  affecting their inputs. We present the "Noisy Input
                  GP", which uses a simple local-linearisation to
                  refer the input noise into heteroscedastic output
                  noise, and compare it to other methods both
                  theoretically and empirically. We show that this
                  technique leads to a effective model for nonlinear
                  functions with input and output noise. We then
                  consider the broad topic of GP state space models
                  for application to dynamical systems. We discuss a
                  very wide variety of approaches for using GPs in
                  state space models, including introducing a new
                  method based on moment-matching, which consistently
                  gave the best performance. We analyse the methods in
                  some detail including providing a systematic
                  comparison between approximate-analytic and particle
                  methods. To our knowledge such a comparison has not
                  been provided before in this area. Finally, we
                  investigate an automatic control learning framework,
                  which uses Gaussian Processes to model a system for
                  which we wish to design a controller. Controller
                  design for complex systems is a difficult task and
                  thus a framework which allows an automatic design
                  directly from data promises to be extremely
                  useful. We demonstrate that the previously published
                  framework cannot cope with the presence of
                  observation noise but that the introduction of a
                  state space model dramatically improves its
                  performance. This contribution, along with some
                  other suggested improvements opens the door for this
                  framework to be used in real-world applications.},

                  points corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise. To make
                  computations tractable we use a local linear
                  expansion about each input point. This allows the

                  proportional to the squared gradient of the GP
                  posterior mean. The input noise hyperparameters are
                  trained alongside other hyperparameters by the usual

                  millions of reads are produced. To gain knowledge
                  from these experiments the first thing to be done is
                  finding the genomic origin of the reads, i.e.,
                  mapping the reads to a reference genome. In this new
                  situation, conventional alignment tools are
                  obsolete, as they cannot handle this huge amount of
                  data in a reasonable amount of time. Thus, new
                  mapping algorithms have been developed, which are
                  fast at the expense of a small decrease in
                  accuracy. In this chapter we discuss the current
                  problems in short read mapping and show that mapping
                  reads correctly is a nontrivial task. Through simple
                  experiments with both real and synthetic data, we
                  demonstrate that different mappers can give
                  different results depending on the type of data, and
                  that a considerable fraction of uniquely mapped
                  reads is potentially mapped to an incorrect
                  location. Furthermore, we provide simple statistical
                  results on the expected number of random matches in
                  a genome (E-value) and the probability of a random
                  match as a function of read length. Finally, we show
                  that quality scores contain valuable information for
                  mapping and why mapping quality should be evaluated
                  in a probabilistic manner. In the end, we discuss
                  the potential of improving the performance of
                  current methods by considering these quality scores

                  reflect the reality of modern data analysis and we
                  develop new models that allow for a principled
                  exploration and use of data in these settings. We
                  place emphasis on Bayesian approaches to learning
                  and the advantages that come with the Bayesian
                  methodology. Our port of departure is a
                  generalisation of latent variable models to members
                  of the exponential family of distributions. This
                  generalisation allows for the analysis of data that
                  may be real-valued, binary, counts, non-negative or
                  a heterogeneous set of these data types. The model
                  unifies various existing models and constructs for
                  unsupervised settings, the complementary framework
                  to the generalised linear models in regression.<br>
                  Moving to structural considerations, we develop
                  Bayesian methods for learning sparse latent
                  representations. We define ideas of weakly and
                  strongly sparse vectors and investigate the classes
                  of prior distributions that give rise to these forms
                  of sparsity, namely the scale-mixture of Gaussians
                  and the spike-and-slab distribution. Based on these
                  sparsity favouring priors, we develop and compare
                  methods for sparse matrix factorisation and present
                  the first comparison of these sparse learning
                  approaches. As a second structural consideration, we
                  develop models with the ability to generate
                  correlated binary vectors. Moment-matching is used
                  to allow binary data with specified correlation to
                  be generated, based on dichotomisation of the
                  Gaussian distribution. We then develop a novel and
                  simple method for binary PCA based on Gaussian
                  dichotomisation. The third generalisation considers
                  the extension of matrix factorisation models to
                  multi-dimensional arrays of data that are
                  increasingly prevalent. We develop the first
                  Bayesian model for non-negative tensor factorisation
                  and explore the relationship between this model and
                  the previously described models for matrix
                  factorisation.},

                  established as one of the key tools for
                  dimensionality reduction when dealing with real
                  valued data. Approaches such as exponential family
                  PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation have
                  successfully extended PCA to non-Gaussian data
                  types, but these techniques fail to take advantage
                  of Bayesian inference and can suffer from problems
                  of overfitting and poor generalisation. This paper
                  presents a fully probabilistic approach to PCA,
                  which is generalised to the exponential family,
                  based on Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. We describe
                  the model which is based on a factorisation of the
                  observed data matrix, and show performance of the

                  generated immense research interest, with many
                  successful applications in diverse areas such as
                  signal acquisition, image coding, genomics and
                  collaborative filtering. While existing work
                  highlights the many advantages of L1 methods, in
                  this paper we find that L1 regularisation often
                  dramatically under-performs in terms of predictive
                  performance when compared to other methods for
                  inferring sparsity. We focus on unsupervised latent
                  variable models, and develop L1 minimising factor
                  models, Bayesian variants of "L1", and Bayesian
                  models with a stronger L0-like sparsity induced
                  through spike-and-slab distributions. These
                  spike-and-slab Bayesian factor models encourage
                  sparsity while accounting for uncertainty in a
                  principled manner, and avoid unnecessary shrinkage
                  of non-zero values. We demonstrate on a number of
                  data sets that in practice spike-and-slab Bayesian
                  methods out-perform L1 minimisation, even on a com-
                  putational budget. We thus highlight the need to
                  re-assess the wide use of L1 methods in
                  sparsity-reliant applications, particularly when we
                  care about generalising to previously unseen data,
                  and provide an alternative that, over many varying
                  conditions, provides improved generalisation

                  budgets are large and highly parallelised. By using
                  representative subsets of the available data to
                  build approximate posteriors, sparse models
                  dramatically reduce the computational costs of
                  surrogate modelling by relying on a small set of
                  pseudo-observations, the so-called inducing points,
                  in lieu of the full data set. However, current
                  approaches to design inducing points are not
                  appropriate within BO loops as they seek to reduce
                  global uncertainty in the objective function. Thus,
                  the high-fidelity modelling of promising and
                  data-dense regions required for precise optimisation
                  is sacrificed and computational resources are
                  instead wasted on modelling areas of the space
                  already known to be sub-optimal. Inspired by
                  entropy-based BO methods, we propose a novel
                  inducing point design that uses a principled
                  information-theoretic criterion to select inducing
                  points. By choosing inducing points to maximally
                  reduce both global uncertainty and uncertainty in
                  the maximum value of the objective function, we
                  build surrogate models able to support

                  genome including DNA methylation and histone
                  modifications that regulate the expression of
                  underlying genes. A consistent profile of gene
                  expression changes in end- stage cardiomyopathy led
                  us to hypothesise that distinct global patterns of
                  the epigenome may also exist.  Methods and
                  Results. We constructed genome-wide maps of DNA
                  methylation and Histone-3 Lysine-36 tri-methylation
                  (H3K36me3)-enrichment for cardiomyopathic and normal
                  human hearts. 506Mb of sequence per library was
                  generated by high-throughput sequencing, covering 24
                  million out of the 28 million CG di-nucleotides in
                  the human genome. DNA methylation was significantly
                  different in promoter CpG-islands (CGI), intra-genic
                  CGI, gene bodies and H3K36me3-enriched regions of
                  the genome. Moreover DNA methylation differences
                  were present in promoters of upregulated genes but
                  not down-regulated genes. The profile of
                  H3K36me3-enrichment itself was also significantly
                  different in protein-coding regions of the genome.
                  Conclusions. Distinct epigenomic patterns exist in
                  important DNA elements of the human cardiac genome
                  in end-stage cardiomyopathy. If epigenomic patterns
                  track with disease progression, assays for the
                  epigenome may be more useful than quantification of
                  mRNA for assessing prognosis in heart failure. These
                  results open up an important new horizon of research
                  and further studies will be needed to determine how
                  epigenomics contribute to altered gene expression in
                  cardiomyopathy.}

                  posterior distributions over undirected model

                  variational mean- field approximations generally

  abstract =	 {Dropout regularization of deep neural networks has
                  been a mysterious yet effective tool to prevent
                  overfitting. Explanations for its success range from
                  the prevention of co-adapted weights to it being a
                  form of cheap Bayesian inference. We propose a novel
                  framework for understanding multiplicative noise in
                  neural networks, considering continuous
                  distributions as well as Bernoulli noise
                  (i.e. dropout). We show that multiplicative noise
                  induces structured shrinkage priors on a network's
                  weights. We derive the equivalence through
                  reparametrization properties of scale mixtures and
                  without invoking any approximations. Given the
                  equivalence, we then show that dropout's Monte Carlo
                  training objective approximates marginal MAP
                  estimation. We leverage these insights to propose a
                  novel shrinkage framework for resnets, terming the
                  prior 'automatic depth determination' as it is the
                  natural analog of automatic relevance determination
                  for network depth. Lastly, we investigate two
                  inference strategies that improve upon the
                  aforementioned MAP approximation in regression
                  benchmarks.}

                  data-modelling contexts ranging from robotics to the
                  social sciences, but they have been largely
                  overlooked by the machine learning community. This
                  paper partially redresses this imbalance by
                  extending some standard probabilistic modelling
                  tools to the circular domain. First we introduce a
                  new multivariate distribution over circular
                  variables, called the multivariate Generalised von
                  Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution can be
                  constructed by restricting and renormalising a
                  general multivariate Gaussian distribution to the
                  unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate
                  circular distributions are shown to be special cases
                  of this construction. Second, we introduce a new
                  probabilistic model for circular regression, that is
                  inspired by Gaussian Processes, and a method for
                  probabilistic principal component analysis with
                  circular hidden variables. These models can leverage
                  standard modelling tools (e.g. covariance functions
                  and methods for automatic relevance
                  determination). Third, we show that the posterior
                  distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution
                  which enables development of an efficient
                  variational free-energy scheme for performing
                  approximate inference and approximate
                  maximum-likelihood learning.},

                  suggesting the need for feature selection in

                  good top-layer representations by alternately
                  sampling the kernel from a distribution over
                  positive semi-definite matrices and performing
                  nonlinear transformations. A particular deep kernel
                  process, the deep Wishart process (DWP), is of
                  particular interest because its prior can be made
                  equivalent to deep Gaussian process (DGP) priors for
                  kernels that can be expressed entirely in terms of
                  Gram matrices. However, inference in DWPs has not

                  posterior for the DWP that includes dependency
                  across layers. We develop a doubly-stochastic
                  inducing-point inference scheme for the DWP and show
                  experimentally that inference in the DWP can improve
                  performance over doing inference in a DGP with the
                  equivalent prior.}

                  are better tests of out-of-distribution
                  uncertainty. We demonstrate that the neural linear
                  model is a simple method that shows generally good
                  performance on these tasks, but at the cost of
                  requiring good hyperparameter tuning.}

                  networks with the reliable uncertainty estimates of
                  Gaussian processes. One crucial aspect of these
                  models is an expectation that, because they are
                  treated as Gaussian process models optimized using
                  the marginal likelihood, they are protected from
                  overfitting. However, we identify situations where
                  this is not the case. We explore this behavior,
                  explain its origins and consider how it applies to
                  real datasets. Through careful experimentation on
                  the UCI, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace datasets, we find
                  that the overfitting from overparameterized maximum
                  marginal likelihood, in which the model is "somewhat
                  Bayesian", can in certain scenarios be worse than
                  that from not being Bayesian at all. We explain how
                  and when DKL can still be successful by
                  investigating optimization dynamics. We also find
                  that failures of DKL can be rectified by a fully
                  Bayesian treatment, which leads to the desired
                  performance improvements over standard neural
                  networks and Gaussian processes.}

                  explore two hypotheses to explain this:
                  'overfitting' by the attack, and mismatch between
                  the model on which the attack is generated and that
                  to which the attack is transferred. Regardless of
                  the mitigation strategies suggested by these
                  hypotheses, the colluding inputs transfer no better
                  than adversarial inputs that are generated

                  functions, infinite graphs or infinite
                  permutations. The problem has generated much
                  interest in machine learning, where it is treated
                  heuristically, but has not been studied in full
                  generality in nonparametric Bayesian statistics,
                  which tends to focus on models over probability
                  distributions. Our approach applies a standard tool
                  of stochastic process theory, the construction of
                  stochastic processes from their finite-dimensional
                  marginal distributions. The main contribution of the
                  paper is a generalization of the classic Kolmogorov
                  extension theorem to conditional probabilities. This
                  extension allows a rigorous construction of
                  nonparametric Bayesian models from systems of
                  finitedimensional, parametric Bayes equations. Using
                  this approach, we show (i) how existence of a
                  conjugate posterior for the nonparametric model can
                  be guaranteed by choosing conjugate
                  finite-dimensional models in the construction, (ii)
                  how the mapping to the posterior parameters of the
                  nonparametric model can be explicitly determined,
                  and (iii) that the construction of conjugate models
                  in essence requires the finite-dimensional models to
                  be in the exponential family. As an application of
                  our constructive framework, we derive a model on
                  infinite permutations, the nonparametric Bayesian
                  analogue of a model recently proposed for the

                  framework for conceptualizing and constructing
                  adaptive autonomous systems under resource
                  constraints. The first part of this thesis contains
                  a concise presentation of the foundations of
                  classical agency: namely the formalizations of
                  decision making and learning. Decision making
                  includes: (a) subjective expected utility (SEU)
                  theory, the framework of decision making under
                  uncertainty; (b) the maximum SEU principle to choose
                  the optimal solution; and (c) its application to the
                  design of autonomous systems, culminating in the
                  Bellman optimality equations. Learning includes: (a)
                  Bayesian probability theory, the theory for
                  reasoning under uncertainty that extends logic; and
                  (b) Bayes-Optimal agents, the application of
                  Bayesian probability theory to the design of optimal
                  adaptive agents. Then, two major problems of the
                  maximum SEU principle are highlighted: (a) the
                  prohibitive computational costs and (b) the need for
                  the causal precedence of the choice of the
                  policy. The second part of this thesis tackles the
                  two aforementioned problems.  First, an
                  information-theoretic notion of resources in
                  autonomous systems is established. Second, a
                  framework for resource-bounded agency is
                  introduced. This includes: (a) a maximum bounded SEU
                  principle that is derived from a set of axioms of
                  utility; (b) an axiomatic model of probabilistic
                  causality, which is applied for the formalization of
                  autonomous systems having uncertainty over their
                  policy and environment; and (c) the Bayesian control
                  rule, which is derived from the maximum bounded SEU
                  principle and the model of causality, implementing a
                  stochastic adaptive control law that deals with the
                  case where autonomous agents are uncertain about
                  their policy and environment.},

                  propose that rewards can be defined for any
                  probability distribution based on three desiderata,
                  namely that rewards should be real- valued, additive
                  and order-preserving, where the later implies that
                  more probable events should also be more
                  desirable. Our main result states that rewards are
                  then uniquely determined by the negative information
                  content. To analyze stochastic processes, we define
                  the utility of a realization as its reward rate.
                  Under this interpretation, we show that the expected
                  utility of a stochastic process is its negative
                  entropy rate. Furthermore, we apply our results to
                  analyze agent-environment interactions. We show that
                  the expected utility that will actually be achieved
                  by the agent is given by the negative cross-entropy
                  from the input-output (I/O) distribution of the
                  coupled interaction system and the agent's I/O
                  distribution. Thus, our results allow for an
                  information-theoretic interpretation of the notion
                  of utility and the characterization of
                  agent-environment interactions in terms of entropy

                  artificial intelligence research. Here we formalize
                  adaptive agents as mixture distributions over
                  sequences of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each
                  distribution of the mixture constitutes a "possible
                  world", but the agent does not know which of the
                  possible worlds it is actually facing. The problem
                  is to adapt the I/O stream in a way that is
                  compatible with the true world. A natural measure of
                  adaptation can be obtained by the Kullback Leibler
                  (KL) divergence between the I/O distribution of the
                  true world and the I/O distribution expected by the
                  agent that is uncertain about possible worlds. In
                  the case of pure input streams, the Bayesian mixture
                  provides a well-known solution for this problem. We
                  show, however, that in the case of I/O streams this
                  solution breaks down, because outputs are issued by
                  the agent itself and require a different
                  probabilistic syntax as provided by intervention
                  calculus. Based on this calculus, we obtain a
                  Bayesian control rule that allows modeling adaptive
                  behavior with mixture distributions over I/O
                  streams. This rule might allow for a novel approach
                  to adaptive control based on a minimum
                  KL-principle.}

                  solution is the well-known Bayesian
                  predictor. However, if the agent is active, then its
                  past actions need to be treated as causal
                  interventions on the I/O stream rather than normal
                  probability conditions.  Here it is shown that the
                  solution to this new variational problem is given by
                  a stochastic controller called the Bayesian control
                  rule, which implements adaptive behavior as a
                  mixture of experts. Furthermore, it is shown that
                  under mild assumptions, the Bayesian control rule
                  converges to the control law of the most suitable
                  expert.},

  abstract =	 {Classic decision-theory is based on the maximum
                  expected utility (MEU) principle, but crucially
                  ignores the resource costs incurred when determining
                  optimal decisions. Here we propose an axiomatic
                  framework for bounded decision-making that considers
                  resource costs. Agents are formalized as probability
                  measures over input-output streams. We postulate
                  that any such probability measure can be assigned a
                  corresponding conjugate utility function based on
                  three axioms: utilities should be real-valued,
                  additive and monotonic mappings of probabilities. We
                  show that these axioms enforce a unique conversion
                  law between utility and probability (and thereby,
                  information).  Moreover, we show that this relation
                  can be characterized as a variational principle:
                  given a utility function, its conjugate probability
                  measure maximizes a free utility
                  functional. Transformations of probability measures
                  can then be formalized as a change in free utility
                  due to the addition of new constraints expressed by
                  a target utility function. Accordingly, one obtains
                  a criterion to choose a probability measure that
                  trades off the maximization of a target utility
                  function and the cost of the deviation from a
                  reference distribution. We show that optimal
                  control, adaptive estimation and adaptive control
                  problems can be solved this way in a
                  resource-efficient way. When resource costs are
                  ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our
                  formalization might thus provide a principled
                  approach to bounded rationality that establishes a
                  close link to information theory.}

                  employ an axiomatic framework for bounded rational
                  decision-making based on a thermodynamic
                  interpretation of resource costs as information
                  costs. This leads to a variational free utility
                  principle akin to thermodynamical free energy that
                  trades off utility and information costs. We show
                  that bounded optimal control solutions can be
                  derived from this variational principle, which leads
                  in general to stochastic policies. Furthermore, we
                  show that risk-sensitive and robust (minimax)
                  control schemes fall out naturally from this
                  framework if the environment is considered as a

  abstract =	 {1. The UK Government‚Äôs draft ‚ÄòAlgorithmic
                  Transparency Standard‚Äô is intended to provide a
                  standardised way for public bodies and government
                  departments to provide information about how
                  algorithmic tools are being used to support
                  decisions. The research discussed in this report was
                  conducted in parallel to the piloting of the
                  Standard by the Cabinet Office and the Centre for
                  Data Ethics and Innovation.  2. We conducted
                  semi-structured interviews with respondents from
                  across UK policing and commercial bodies involved in
                  policing technologies. Our aim was to explore the
                  implications for police forces of participation in
                  the Standard, to identify rewards, risks, challenges
                  for the police, and areas where the Standard could
                  be improved, and therefore to contribute to the
                  exploration of policy options for expansion of
                  participation in the Standard.  3. Algorithmic
                  transparency is both achievable for policing and
                  could bring significant rewards. A key reward of
                  police participation in the Standard is that it
                  provides the opportunity to demonstrate proficient
                  implementation of technology-driven policing, thus
                  enhancing earned trust. Research participants
                  highlighted the public good that could result from
                  the considered use of algorithms.  4. Participants
                  noted, however, a risk of misperception of the
                  dangers of policing technology, especially if use of
                  algorithmic tools was not appropriately compared to
                  the status quo and current methods.
                  5. Participation in the Standard provides an
                  opportunity to develop increased sharing among
                  police forces of best practices (and things to
                  avoid), and increased thoughtfulness among police
                  force personnel in building and implementing new
                  tools. Research participants were keen for
                  compliance with the Standard to become an integral
                  part of a holistic system to drive reflective
                  practice across policing around the development and
                  deployment of algorithmic technology. This could
                  enable police to learn from each other, facilitate
                  good policy choices and decrease wasted
                  costs. Otherwise, the Standard may come to be
                  regarded as an administrative burden rather than a
                  benefit for policing.  6. Several key areas for
                  amendment and improvement from the perspective of
                  policing were identified in the research. These
                  could improve the Standard for the benefit of all
                  participants. These include a need for clarification
                  of the scope of the Standard, and the stage of
                  project development at which the Standard should
                  apply. It is recommended that consideration be given
                  to a ‚ÄòStandard-Lite‚Äô for projects at the pilot or
                  early stages of the development process in order to
                  gain public understanding of new tools and
                  applications. Furthermore, the Standard would
                  benefit from a more substantial glossary (to include
                  relevant policing terms) and additional guidance on
                  the level of detail required in each section and how
                  accuracy rates should be described, justified and
                  explained in order to ensure consistency.  7. The
                  research does not suggest any overriding reason why
                  the Standard should not be applied in
                  policing. Suitable exemptions for sensitive contexts
                  and tradecraft would be required, however, and
                  consideration given to ensuring that forces have the
                  resources to comply with the Standard and to respond
                  to the increased public interest that could
                  ensue. Limiting the scope initially to tools on a
                  defined list (to include the most high-risk tools,
                  such as those that produce individualised
                  risk/predictive scores) could assist in mitigating
                  concerns over sensitive policing capabilities and
                  resourcing. A non-public version of the Standard for
                  sensitive applications and tools could also be
                  considered, which would be available to bodies with
                  an independent oversight function.  8. To support
                  police compliance with the Standard, supplier
                  responsibilities ‚Äì including appropriate disclosure
                  of algorithmic functionality, data inputs and
                  performance ‚Äì should be covered in procurement
                  contracts and addressed up front as a mandatory
                  requirement of doing business with the police.
                  9. As well as contributing to the piloting of the
                  Standard, it is recommended that the findings of
                  this report are considered at NPCC level, by the
                  College of Policing and by the office of the Chief
                  Scientific Advisor for Policing, as new sector-led
                  guidance, best practice and policy are developed.}

                  subdivide nodes of the network into clusters; the
                  probability of a link between any two nodes then
                  depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently
                  available models can be classified by whether
                  clusters are disjoint or are allowed to
                  overlap. These models can explain a "flat"
                  clustering structure.  Hierarchical Bayesian models
                  provide a natural approach to capture more complex
                  dependencies. We propose a model in which objects
                  are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each
                  feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups
                  (subclusters), corresponding to a second layer of
                  hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model
                  achieves significantly improved predictive
                  performance on social and biological link prediction
                  tasks.  The results indicate that models with a
                  single layer hierarchy over-simplify real networks.}

                  specifically gamma processes, to construct a
                  countably infinite graph with weighted edges.  By
                  enforcing symmetry to make the edges undirected we
                  define a prior over random walks on graphs that
                  results in a reversible Markov chain. The resulting
                  prior over infinite transition matrices is closely
                  related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but
                  enforces reversibility. A reinforcement scheme has
                  recently been proposed with similar properties, but
                  the de Finetti measure is not well characterised.
                  We take the alternative approach of explicitly
                  constructing the mixing measure, which allows more

                  point of view of causal modeling, the structure of

                  that give rise to dependences between

                  autonomous modules of generative models that make

                  distribution, lending themselves to transfer between

                  causes numerical issues and instability in
                  optimization. Our experiments in model-based
                  reinforcement learning imply that the problem is not
                  just a numerical issue, but it may be caused by a
                  fundamental chaos-like nature of long chains of
                  nonlinear computations. Not only do the magnitudes
                  of the gradients become large, the direction of the
                  gradients becomes essentially random. We show that
                  reparameterization gradients suffer from the
                  problem, while likelihood ratio gradients are
                  robust. Using our insights, we develop a model-based

                  the performance of previous data-efficient learning
                  algorithms. Finally, we invent the total propagation
                  algorithm, which efficiently computes a union over
                  all pathwise derivative depths during a single
                  backwards pass, automatically giving greater weight
                  to estimators with lower variance, sometimes

                  for probabilistic modeling, as they permit a wide

                  Recent ``deep-learning-style'' implementations of
                  PCs strive for a better scalability, but are still
                  difficult to train on real-world data, due to their
                  sparsely connected computational graphs.  In this
                  paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a novel
                  implementation design for PCs, improving prior art
                  in several regards.  At their core, EiNets combine a
                  large number of arithmetic operations in a single
                  monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and
                  memory savings of up to two orders of magnitude, in
                  comparison to previous implementations.  As an
                  algorithmic contribution, we show that the
                  implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM) can
                  be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic
                  differentiation.  Furthermore, we demonstrate that
                  EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously
                  out of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they
                  can be used as faithful generative image models.}

                  independent optimisation problems per

                  assumption of independent and identically
                  distributed (i.i.d.) data. In reality, however, this
                  assumption is almost always violated due to
                  distribution shifts between environments. Although
                  valuable learning signals can be provided by
                  heterogeneous data from changing distributions, it
                  is also known that learning under arbitrary
                  (adversarial) changes is impossible. Causality
                  provides a useful framework for modeling
                  distribution shifts, since causal models encode both
                  observational and interventional distributions. In
                  this work, we explore the sparse mechanism shift
                  hypothesis, which posits that distribution shifts
                  occur due to a small number of changing causal
                  conditionals. Motivated by this idea, we apply it to
                  learning causal structure from heterogeneous
                  environments, where i.i.d. data only allows for
                  learning an equivalence class of graphs without
                  restrictive assumptions. We propose the Mechanism
                  Shift Score (MSS), a score-based approach amenable
                  to various empirical estimators, which provably
                  identifies the entire causal structure with high
                  probability if the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis
                  holds. Empirically, we verify behavior predicted by
                  the theory and compare multiple estimators and score
                  functions to identify the best approaches in
                  practice. Compared to other methods, we show how MSS
                  bridges a gap by both being nonparametric as well as
                  explicitly leveraging sparse changes.},

                  might be identified by purely unsupervised,
                  statistical means. Here, we show that a Hidden
                  Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (HSLDS) model -
                  in which multiple linear dynamical laws approximate
                  and nonlinear and potentially non-stationary
                  dynamical process - is able to distinguish dynamical
                  regimes within single-trial motor cortical activity
                  associated with the preparation and initiation of
                  hand movements. The regimes are identified without
                  reference to behavioural or experimental epochs, but
                  nonetheless transitions between them correlate
                  strongly with external events whose timing may vary
                  from trial to trial. The HSLDS model also performs
                  better than recent comparable models in predicting
                  the firing rate of an isolated neuron based on the
                  firing rates of others, suggesting that it captures
                  more of the "Shared variance" of the data. Thus, the
                  method is able to trace the dynamical processes

                  recent years provides great potential for improving
                  supervised models.  When the cost of acquiring
                  labels is high, probabilistic active learning
                  methods can be used to greedily select the most
                  informative data points to be labeled. However, for
                  many large-scale problems standard greedy procedures
                  become computationally infeasible and suffer from
                  negligible model change. In this paper, we introduce
                  a novel Bayesian batch active learning approach that
                  mitigates these issues. Our approach is motivated by
                  approximating the complete data posterior of the
                  model parameters. While naive batch construction
                  methods result in correlated queries, our algorithm
                  produces diverse batches that enable efficient
                  active learning at scale. We derive interpretable
                  closed-form solutions akin to existing active
                  learning procedures for linear models, and
                  generalize to arbitrary models using random
                  projections. We demonstrate the benefits of our
                  approach on several large-scale regression and
                  classification tasks.}

                  learning to truly complex tasks, as we need to
                  generalize locally learned policies over different
                  task contexts. Contextual policy search offers
                  data-efficient learning and generalization by
                  explicitly conditioning the policy on a parametric
                  context space. In this paper, we further structure
                  the contextual policy representation. We propose to
                  factor contexts into two components: target contexts
                  that describe the task objectives, e.g. target
                  position for throwing a ball; and environment
                  contexts that characterize the environment,
                  e.g. initial position or mass of the ball. Our key
                  observation is that experience can be directly
                  generalized over target contexts. We show that this
                  can be easily exploited in contextual policy search
                  algorithms. In particular, we apply factorization to
                  a Bayesian optimization approach to contextual
                  policy search both in sampling-based and active
                  learning settings. Our simulation results show
                  faster learning and better generalization in various
                  robotic domains. See our supplementary video:

                  proven to be a powerful, general tool for learning
                  complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency is
                  often impractically large for solving challenging
                  real-world problems, even for off-policy algorithms
                  such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic
                  model-free RL is that the learning signal consists
                  only of scalar rewards, ignoring much of the rich
                  information contained in state transition
                  tuples. Model-based RL uses this information, by
                  training a predictive model, but often does not
                  achieve the same asymptotic performance as
                  model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce
                  temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of
                  goal-conditioned value functions that can be trained
                  with model-free learning and used for model-based
                  control. TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and
                  model-based RL: they leverage the rich information
                  in state transitions to learn very efficiently,
                  while still attaining asymptotic performance that
                  exceeds that of direct model-based RL methods. Our
                  experimental results show that, on a range of
                  continuous control tasks, TDMs provide a substantial
                  improvement in efficiency compared to
                  state-of-the-art model-based and model-free

                  contains a large number of potentially irrelevant
                  features. This paper proposes a new Bayesian
                  framework for determining the relevance of input
                  features. This approach extends one of the most
                  successful Bayesian methods for feature selection
                  and sparse learning, known as Automatic Relevance
                  Determination (ARD). ARD finds the relevance of
                  features by optimizing the model marginal
                  likelihood, also known as the evidence. We show that
                  this can lead to overfitting. To address this
                  problem, we propose Predictive ARD based on
                  estimating the predictive performance of the
                  classifier. While the actual leave-one-out
                  predictive performance is generally very costly to
                  compute, the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm
                  proposed by Minka provides an estimate of this
                  predictive performance as a side-effect of its
                  iterations. We exploit this in our algorithm to do
                  feature selection, and to select data points in a
                  sparse Bayesian kernel classifier. Moreover, we
                  provide two other improvements to previous
                  algorithms, by replacing Laplace's approximation
                  with the generally more accurate EP, and by
                  incorporating the fast optimization algorithm
                  proposed by Faul and Tipping. Our experiments show
                  that our method based on the EP estimate of
                  predictive performance is more accurate on test data
                  than relevance determination by optimizing the
                  evidence.}

                  potentially noisy graph data, it appears
                  self-evident that having multiple observations would
                  be better than having just one. However, it turns
                  out that the inconsistencies introduced when
                  different graph instances have different edge sets
                  pose a serious challenge.  In this work we address
                  this challenge for the problem of finding maximum
                  weighted cliques.  We introduce the concept of most
                  persistent soft-clique.  This is subset of vertices,
                  that 1) is almost fully or at least densely
                  connected, 2) occurs in all or almost all graph
                  instances, and 3) has the maximum weight.  We
                  present a measure of clique-ness, that essentially
                  counts the number of edge missing to make a subset
                  of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we
                  show that the problem of finding the most persistent
                  soft-clique problem can be cast either as: a) a
                  max-min two person game optimization problem, or b)
                  a min-min soft margin optimization problem.  Both
                  formulations lead to the same solution when using a
                  partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization
                  problems.  By experiments on synthetic data and on
                  real social network data we show that the proposed
                  method is able to reliably find soft cliques in
                  graph data, even if that is distorted by random
                  noise or unreliable observations.}

                  the number of binary latent variables, and their

                  cases. This has motivated the recent proliferation
                  of a number of cost-effective approximations to GPs,
                  both for classification and for regression.  In this
                  paper we analyze one popular approximation to GPs
                  for regression: the reduced rank
                  approximation. While generally GPs are equivalent to
                  infinite linear models, we show that Reduced Rank
                  Gaussian Processes (RRGPs) are equivalent to finite
                  sparse linear models. We also introduce the concept
                  of degenerate GPs and show that they correspond to
                  inappropriate priors. We show how to modify the RRGP
                  to prevent it from being degenerate at test
                  time. Training RRGPs consists both in learning the
                  covariance function hyperparameters and the support
                  set. We propose a method for learning
                  hyperparameters for a given support set. We also
                  review the Sparse Greedy GP (SGGP) approximation
                  (Somla and Bartlett, 2001), which is a way of
                  learning the support set for given hyperparameters
                  based on approximating the posterior. We propose an
                  alternative method to the SGGP that has better
                  generalization capabilities. Finally we make
                  experiments to compare the different ways of
                  training a RRGP. We provide some Matlab code for
                  learning RRGPs.},

                  on the influence of metadata and response variables
                  on the distribution of words in a document. While
                  effective, MNIR has no way to exploit structure in
                  the corpus to improve its predictions or facilitate
                  exploratory data analysis. On the other hand,
                  traditional probabilistic topic models (like latent
                  Dirichlet allocation) capture natural heterogeneity
                  in a collection but do not account for external
                  variables. In this paper, we introduce the inverse
                  regression topic model (IRTM), a mixed-membership
                  extension of MNIR that combines the strengths of
                  both methodologies. We present two inference
                  algorithms for the IRTM: an efficient batch
                  estimation algorithm and an online variant, which is
                  suitable for large corpora.  We apply these methods
                  to a corpus of 73K Congressional press releases and
                  another of 150K Yelp reviews, demonstrating that the

                  choice for computing Bayesian integrals that are not
                  analytically tractable. However the success of this
                  method may require a very large number of
                  evaluations of the (un-normalized) posterior and its
                  partial derivatives. In situations where the
                  posterior is computationally costly to evaluate,
                  this may lead to an unacceptable computational load
                  for HMC.  I propose to use a Gaussian Process model
                  of the (log of the) posterior for most of the
                  computations required by HMC. Within this scheme
                  only occasional evaluation of the actual posterior
                  is required to guarantee that the samples generated
                  have exactly the desired distribution, even if the
                  GP model is somewhat inaccurate. The method is
                  demonstrated on a 10 dimensional problem, where 200
                  evaluations suffice for the generation of 100
                  roughly independent points from the posterior. Thus,
                  the proposed scheme allows Bayesian treatment of
                  models with posteriors that are computationally
                  demanding, such as models involving computer
                  simulation.}

                  statistical approach for evaluating such methods.
                  In these experimental designs the sources of
                  uncertainty in the estimated generalisation
                  performances due to both variation in training and
                  test sets are accounted for. The framework allows
                  for estimation of generalisation performance as well
                  as statistical tests of significance for pairwise
                  comparisons. Two experimental designs are
                  recommended and supported by the DELVE software
                  environment.<br> Two new non-parametric Bayesian
                  learning methods relying on Gaussian process priors
                  over functions are developed.  These priors are
                  controlled by hyperparameters which set the
                  characteristic length scale for each input
                  dimension. In the simplest method, these parameters
                  are fit from the data using optimization.  In the
                  second, fully Bayesian method, a Markov chain Monte
                  Carlo technique is used to integrate over the
                  hyperparameters. One advantage of these Gaussian
                  process methods is that the priors and
                  hyperparameters of the trained models are easy to
                  interpret.<br> The Gaussian process methods are
                  benchmarked against several other methods, on
                  regression tasks using both real data and data
                  generated from realistic simulations. The
                  experiments show that small datasets are unsuitable
                  for benchmarking purposes because the uncertainties
                  in performance measurements are large. A second set
                  of experiments provide strong evidence that the
                  bagging procedure is advantageous for the
                  Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)
                  method.<br> The simulated datasets have controlled
                  characteristics which make them useful for
                  understanding the relationship between properties of
                  the dataset and the performance of different
                  methods. The dependency of the performance on
                  available computation time is also investigated. It
                  is shown that a Bayesian approach to learning in
                  multi-layer perceptron neural networks achieves
                  better performance than the commonly used early
                  stopping procedure, even for reasonably short
                  amounts of computation time. The Gaussian process
                  methods are shown to consistently outperform the
                  more conventional methods.}

                  muscle fibre is innervated by several different
                  motor axons. Withdrawal of connections then takes
                  place until each fibre has contact from just a
                  single axon. The evidence suggests that the
                  withdrawal process involves competition between
                  nerve terminals. We examine in formal models several
                  types of competitive mechanism that have been
                  proposed for this phenomenon. We show that a model
                  which combines competition for a presynaptic
                  resource with competition for a postsynaptic
                  resource is superior to others. This model accounts

                  has a biologically plausible

                  side effect of the competitive mechanism rather than
                  a separate non-competitive feature. The model's

                  case, hidden Markov models. Hidden Markov models
                  trained on amino acid sequence or secondary
                  structure data alone have been shown to have
                  potential for addressing the problem of protein fold

                  describes a novel implementation of a Bayesian
                  network which simultaneously learns amino acid
                  sequence, secondary structure and residue
                  accessibility for proteins of known
                  three-dimensional structure. An awareness of the
                  errors inherent in predicted secondary structure may
                  be incorporated into the model by means of a
                  confusion matrix. Training and validation data have
                  been derived for a number of protein superfamilies

  abstract =	 {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a popular
                  framework for modeling complex data distributions;
                  they can be efficiently trained via variational
                  inference by maximizing the evidence lower bound
                  (ELBO), at the expense of a gap to the exact
                  (log-)marginal likelihood. While VAEs are commonly
                  used for representation learning, it is unclear why
                  ELBO maximization would yield useful
                  representations, since unregularized maximum
                  likelihood estimation cannot invert the
                  data-generating process. Yet, VAEs often succeed at
                  this task. We seek to elucidate this apparent
                  paradox by studying nonlinear VAEs in the limit of
                  near-deterministic decoders. We first prove that, in
                  this regime, the optimal encoder approximately
                  inverts the decoder -- a commonly used but unproven
                  conjecture -- which we refer to as {\em
                  self-consistency}. Leveraging self-consistency, we
                  show that the ELBO converges to a regularized
                  log-likelihood. This allows VAEs to perform what has
                  recently been termed independent mechanism analysis
                  (IMA): it adds an inductive bias towards decoders
                  with column-orthogonal Jacobians, which helps
                  recovering the true latent factors. The gap between
                  ELBO and log-likelihood is therefore welcome, since
                  it bears unanticipated benefits for nonlinear
                  representation learning. In experiments on synthetic
                  and image data, we show that VAEs uncover the true
                  latent factors when the data generating process
                  satisfies the IMA assumption.},

                  classification systems that, after an initial
                  multi-task training phase, can automatically adapt
                  to new tasks encountered at test time. We introduce
                  a conditional neural process based approach to the
                  multi-task classification setting for this purpose,
                  and establish connections to the meta- and few-shot
                  learning literature. The resulting approach, called
                  CNAPs, comprises a classifier whose parameters are
                  modulated by an adaptation network that takes the
                  current task's dataset as input. We demonstrate that
                  CNAPs achieves state-of-the-art results on the
                  challenging Meta-Dataset benchmark indicating
                  high-quality transfer-learning. We show that the
                  approach is robust, avoiding both over-fitting in
                  low-shot regimes and under-fitting in high-shot
                  regimes.  Timing experiments reveal that CNAPs is
                  computationally efficient at test-time as it does
                  not involve gradient based adaptation. Finally, we
                  show that trained models are immediately deployable
                  to continual learning and active learning where they
                  can outperform existing approaches that do not
                  leverage transfer learning.}

                  discusses an approach to domain adaptation which is
                  inspired by a causal interpretation of the
                  multi-task problem. We assume that a covariate shift
                  assumption holds true for a subset of predictor
                  variables: the conditional of the target variable
                  given this subset of predictors is invariant with
                  respect to shifts in those predictors
                  (covariates). We propose to learn the corresponding
                  conditional expectation in the training domains and
                  use it for estimation in the target domain. We
                  further introduce a method which allows for
                  automatic inference of the above subset in
                  regression and classification. We study the

                  setting, in the case where no additional examples
                  are available in the test domain. If a labeled

                  scientists that the mind performs Bayesian
                  reasoning, and if we simultaneously accept the
                  Physical Church-Turing thesis and thus believe that
                  the computational power of the mind is no more than
                  that of a Turing machine, then what limitations are
                  there to the reasoning abilities of the mind?  I
                  give an overview of joint work with Nathanael
                  Ackerman (Harvard, Mathematics) and Cameron Freer
                  (MIT, CSAIL) that bears on the computability and
                  complexity of Bayesian reasoning.  In particular, we
                  prove that conditional probability is in general not
                  computable in the presence of continuous random
                  variables.  However, in light of additional
                  structure in the prior distribution, such as the
                  presence of certain types of noise, or of
                  exchangeability, conditioning is possible.  These
                  results cover most of statistical practice.  At the
                  workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity, we
                  presented results on the computational complexity of
                  conditioning, embedding sharp-P-complete problems in
                  the task of computing conditional probabilities for
                  diffuse continuous random variables.  This work
                  complements older work. For example, under
                  cryptographic assumptions, the computational
                  complexity of producing samples and computing
                  probabilities was separated by Ben-David, Chor,
                  Goldreich and Luby.  In recent work, we also make
                  use of cryptographic assumptions to show that
                  different representations of exchangeable sequences
                  may have vastly different complexity.  However, when
                  faced with an adversary that is computational
                  bounded, these different representations have the
                  same complexity, highlighting the fact that
                  knowledge representation and approximation play a
                  fundamental role in the possibility and plausibility
                  of Bayesian reasoning.}

  abstract =	 {The generic inference and learning algorithm for
                  Gaussian Process (GP) regression has
                  O(N<sup>3</sup>) runtime and O(N<sup>2</sup>) memory
                  complexity, where N is the number of observations in
                  the dataset. Given the computational resources
                  available to a present-day workstation, this implies
                  that GP regression simply <em>cannot be run</em> on
                  large datasets. The need to use non- Gaussian
                  likelihood functions for tasks such as
                  classification adds even more to the computational
                  burden involved.<br> The majority of algorithms
                  designed to improve the scaling of GPs are founded
                  on the idea of approximating the true covariance
                  matrix, which is usually of rank N, with a matrix of
                  rank P, where P&lt;&lt;N. Typically, the true
                  training set is replaced with a smaller,
                  representative (pseudo-) training set such that a
                  specific measure of information loss is minimized.
                  These algorithms typically attain O(P<sup>2</sup>N)
                  runtime and O(PN) space complexity. They are also
                  general in the sense that they are designed to work
                  with <em>any</em> covariance function. In essence,
                  they trade off accuracy with computational
                  complexity. The central contribution of this thesis
                  is to improve scaling instead by exploiting any
                  structure that is present in the covariance matrices
                  generated by <em>particular</em> covariance
                  functions.  Instead of settling for a
                  kernel-independent accuracy/complexity trade off, as
                  is done in much the literature, we often obtain
                  accuracies close to, or exactly equal to the full GP
                  model at a fraction of the computational cost.<br>
                  We define a <em>structured</em> GP as any GP model
                  that is endowed with a kernel which produces
                  structured covariance matrices. A trivial example of
                  a structured GP is one with the linear regression
                  kernel. In this case, given inputs living in
                  R<sup>D</sup>, the covariance matrices generated
                  have rank D -- this results in significant
                  computational gains in the usual case where
                  D&lt;&lt;N. Another case arises when a stationary
                  kernel is evaluated on equispaced, scalar
                  inputs. This results in <em>Toeplitz</em> covariance
                  matrices and all necessary computations can be
                  carried out exactly in O(N log N).<br> This thesis
                  studies four more types of structured GP. First, we
                  comprehensively review the case of kernels
                  corresponding to <em>Gauss-Markov</em> processes
                  evaluated on scalar inputs. Using state-space models
                  we show how (generalised) regression (including
                  hyperparameter learning) can be performed in O(N log
                  N) runtime and O(N) space. Secondly, we study the
                  case where we introduce block structure into the
                  covariance matrix of a GP time-series model by
                  assuming a particular form of nonstationarity a
                  priori. Third, we extend the efficiency of scalar
                  Gauss-Markov processes to higher-dimensional input
                  spaces by assuming <em>additivity</em>. We
                  illustrate the connections between the classical
                  backfitting algorithm and approximate Bayesian
                  inference techniques including Gibbs sampling and
                  variational Bayes. We also show that it is possible
                  to relax the rather strong assumption of additivity
                  without sacrificing O(N log N) complexity, by means
                  of a projection-pursuit style GP regression
                  model. Finally, we study the properties of a GP
                  model with a tensor product kernel evaluated on a
                  multivariate grid of inputs locations. We show that
                  for an <em>arbitrary</em> (regular or irregular)
                  grid the resulting covariance matrices are Kronecker
                  and full GP regression can be implemented in O(N)
                  time and memory usage.<br> We illustrate the power
                  of these methods on several real-world regression
                  datasets which satisfy the assumptions inherent in
                  the structured GP employed. In many cases we obtain
                  performance comparable to the generic GP
                  algorithm. We also analyse the performance
                  degradation when these assumptions are not met, and
                  in several cases show that it is comparable to that
                  observed for sparse GP methods. We provide similar
                  results for regression tasks with non-Gaussian
                  likelihoods, an extension rarely addressed by sparse
                  GP techniques.}

                  called function factorization, that is suitable for
                  problems where an output variable can reasonably be
                  modeled by a number of multiplicative interaction
                  terms between non-linear functions of the
                  inputs. The idea is to approximate a complicated
                  function on a high-dimensional space by the sum of
                  products of simpler functions on lower-dimensional
                  subspaces. Function factorization can be seen as a
                  generalization of matrix and tensor factorization
                  methods, in which the data are approximated by the

                  The Bayesian paradigm for model selection provides a
                  path towards end-to-end learning of invariances
                  using only the training data, by optimising the
                  marginal likelihood. Computing the marginal
                  likelihood is hard for neural networks, but success
                  with tractable approaches that compute the marginal
                  likelihood for the last layer only raises the
                  question of whether this convenient approach might
                  be employed for learning invariances. We show
                  partial success on standard benchmarks, in the
                  low-data regime and on a medical imaging dataset by
                  designing a custom optimisation routine. Introducing
                  a new lower bound to the marginal likelihood allows
                  us to perform inference for a larger class of
                  likelihood functions than before. On the other hand,
                  we demonstrate failure modes on the CIFAR10 dataset,
                  where the last layer approximation is not sufficient
                  due to the increased complexity of our neural
                  network. Our results indicate that once more

                  each factor acts in the world.  In this paper, we
                  test whether 17 unsupervised, weakly supervised, and
                  fully supervised representation learning approaches
                  correctly infer the generative factors of variation
                  in simple datasets (dSprites, Shapes3D, MPI3D) from
                  controlled environments, and on our contributed
                  CelebGlow dataset.  In contrast to prior robustness
                  work that introduces novel factors of variation
                  during test time, such as blur or other
                  (un)structured noise, we here recompose,
                  interpolate, or extrapolate only existing factors of
                  variation from the training data set (e.g., small
                  and medium-sized objects during training and large
                  objects during testing). Models that learn the
                  correct mechanism should be able to generalize to
                  this benchmark.  In total, we train and test 2000+
                  models and observe that all of them struggle to
                  learn the underlying mechanism regardless of
                  supervision signal and architectural bias. Moreover,
                  the generalization capabilities of all tested models
                  drop significantly as we move from artificial
                  datasets towards more realistic real-world datasets.
                  Despite their inability to identify the correct
                  mechanism, the models are quite modular as their
                  ability to infer other in-distribution factors
                  remains fairly stable, providing only a single
                  factor is out-of-distribution. These results point
                  to an important yet understudied problem of learning
                  mechanistic models of observations that can

  abstract =	 {Probabilistic modelling offers a simple and coherent
                  framework to describe the real world in the face of
                  uncertainty. Furthermore, by applying Bayes' rule it
                  is possible to use probabilistic models to make
                  inferences about the state of the world from partial
                  observations. While traditionally probabilistic
                  models were constructed on paper, more recently the
                  approach of probabilistic programming enables users
                  to write the models in executable languages
                  resembling computer programs and to freely mix them
                  with deterministic code.  It has long been
                  recognised that the semantics of programming
                  languages is complicated and the intuitive
                  understanding that programmers have is often
                  inaccurate, resulting in difficult to understand
                  bugs and unexpected program behaviours. Programming
                  languages are therefore studied in a rigorous way
                  using formal languages with mathematically defined
                  semantics. Traditionally formal semantics of
                  probabilistic programs are defined using exact
                  inference results, but in practice exact Bayesian
                  inference is not tractable and approximate methods
                  are used instead, posing a question of how the
                  results of these algorithms relate to the exact
                  results. Correctness of such approximate methods is
                  usually argued somewhat less rigorously, without
                  reference to a formal semantics.  In this
                  dissertation we formally develop denotational
                  semantics for probabilistic programs that correspond
                  to popular sampling algorithms often used in
                  practice. The semantics is defined for an expressive
                  typed lambda calculus with higher-order functions
                  and inductive types, extended with probabilistic
                  effects for sampling and conditioning, allowing
                  continuous distributions and unbounded
                  likelihoods. It makes crucial use of the recently
                  developed formalism of quasi-Borel spaces to bring
                  all these elements together. We provide semantics
                  corresponding to several variants of Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo methods and
                  formally prove a notion of correctness for these
                  algorithms in the context of probabilistic
                  programming.  We also show that the semantic
                  construction can be directly mapped to an
                  implementation using established functional
                  programming abstractions called monad
                  transformers. We develop a compact Haskell library
                  for probabilistic programming closely corresponding
                  to the semantic construction, giving users a high
                  level of assurance in the correctness of the
                  implementation. We also demonstrate on a collection
                  of benchmarks that the library offers performance
                  competitive with existing systems of similar scope.
                  An important property of our construction, both the
                  semantics and the implementation, is the high degree
                  of modularity it offers. All the inference
                  algorithms are constructed by combining small
                  building blocks in a setup where the type system
                  ensures correctness of compositions. We show that
                  with basic building blocks corresponding to vanilla
                  Metropolis-Hastings and Sequential Monte Carlo we
                  can implement more advanced algorithms known in the
                  literature, such as Resample-Move Sequential Monte
                  Carlo, Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings, and
                  Sequential Monte Carlo squared. These
                  implementations are very concise, reducing the
                  effort required to produce them and the scope for
                  bugs. On top of that, our modular construction
                  enables in some cases deterministic testing of
                  randomised inference algorithms, further increasing
                  reliability of the implementation.}

                  forms, but they all express probabilistic models as
                  computational processes using syntax resembling
                  programming languages. In the functional programming
                  community monads are known to offer a convenient and

                  probabilistic models for machine learning, while
                  still offering good performance of inference in
                  challenging models. We use a GADT as an underlying
                  representation of a probability distribution and
                  apply Sequential Monte Carlo-based methods to
                  achieve efficient inference. We define a formal
                  semantics via measure theory. We demonstrate a clean
                  and elegant implementation that achieves performance
                  comparable with Anglican, a state-of-the-art

  abstract =	 { We present an architectural design of a library for
                  Bayesian modelling and inference in modern
                  functional programming languages. The novel aspect
                  of our approach are modular implementations of
                  existing state-of-the-art inference algorithms.  Our
                  design relies on three inherently functional
                  features: higher-order functions, inductive
                  data-types, and support for either type-classes or
                  an expressive module system.  We provide a
                  performant Haskell implementation of this
                  architecture, demonstrating that high-level and
                  modular probabilistic programming can be added as a
                  library in sufficiently expressive languages.  We
                  review the core abstractions in this architecture:
                  inference representations, inference
                  transformations, and inference representation
                  transformers. We then implement concrete instances
                  of these abstractions, counterparts to particle
                  filters and Metropolis-Hastings samplers, which form
                  the basic building blocks of our library. By
                  composing these building blocks we obtain
                  state-of-the-art inference algorithms: Resample-Move
                  Sequential Monte Carlo, Particle Marginal
                  Metropolis-Hastings, and Sequential Monte Carlo
                  Squared. We evaluate our implementation against
                  existing probabilistic programming systems and find
                  it is already competitively performant, although we
                  conjecture that existing functional programming
                  optimisation techniques could reduce the overhead
                  associated with the abstractions we use. We show
                  that our modular design enables deterministic
                  testing of inherently stochastic Monte Carlo
                  algorithms. Finally, we demonstrate using OCaml that
                  an expressive module system can also implement our
                  design.}

                  inference algorithms for probabilistic programming
                  languages, as used in data science and machine
                  learning. Sophisticated inference algorithms are
                  often explained in terms of composition of smaller
                  parts. However, neither their theoretical
                  justification nor their implementation reflects this
                  modularity. We show how to conceptualise and analyse
                  such inference algorithms as manipulating
                  intermediate representations of probabilistic
                  programs using higher-order functions and inductive
                  types, and their denotational semantics.  Semantic
                  accounts of continuous distributions use measurable
                  spaces. However, our use of higher-order functions
                  presents a substantial technical difficulty: it is
                  impossible to define a measurable space structure
                  over the collection of measurable functions between
                  arbitrary measurable spaces that is compatible with
                  standard operations on those functions, such as
                  function application. We overcome this difficulty
                  using quasi-Borel spaces, a recently proposed
                  mathematical structure that supports both function
                  spaces and continuous distributions.  We define a
                  class of semantic structures for representing
                  probabilistic programs, and semantic validity
                  criteria for transformations of these
                  representations in terms of distribution
                  preservation. We develop a collection of building
                  blocks for composing representations. We use these
                  building blocks to validate common inference
                  algorithms such as Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov
                  Chain Monte Carlo. To emphasize the connection
                  between the semantic manipulation and its
                  traditional measure theoretic origins, we use Kock‚Äôs
                  synthetic measure theory. We demonstrate its
                  usefulness by proving a quasi-Borel counterpart to
                  the Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem.}

                  efficient and straightforward to im- plement, since
                  the RKHS moves can be inte- grated out analytically:
                  our proposal distribu- tion in the original space is
                  a normal distribution whose mean and covariance
                  depend on where the current sample lies in the
                  support of the tar- get distribution, and adapts to
                  its local covari- ance structure. Furthermore, the
                  procedure re- quires neither gradients nor any other
                  higher or- der information about the target, making
                  it par- ticularly attractive for contexts such as

                  in the data is often unknown and most models require
                  this parameter as an input. Dirichlet process
                  mixture models are appealing as they can infer the
                  number of clusters from the data. However, these
                  models do not deal with high dimensional data well
                  and can encounter difficulties in inference. We

                  situations where there are changes in covariance

                  issues of data quality and diversity which can be
                  prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing

                  information between class labels to be shared and to
                  improve prediction performance. However, there are
                  different ways by which objects can be related
                  within a relational database.  One traditional way
                  corresponds to a Markov network structure: each
                  existing relation is represented by an undirected
                  edge. This encodes that, conditioned on input
                  features, each object label is independent of other
                  object labels given its neighbors in the
                  graph. However, there is no reason why Markov
                  networks should be the only representation of choice
                  for symmetric dependence structures. Here we discuss
                  the case when relationships are postulated to exist
                  due to \emph{hidden common causes}. We discuss how
                  the resulting graphical model differs from Markov
                  networks, and how it describes different types of
                  real-world relational processes.  A Bayesian
                  nonparametric classification model is built upon
                  this graphical representation and evaluated with
                  several empirical studies.},

                  latent variables are often an important component of
                  graphical models. However, DAG models suffer from an
                  important limitation: the family of DAGs is not
                  closed under marginalization of hidden
                  variables. This means that in general we cannot use
                  a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset
                  of variables in a larger DAG. Directed mixed graphs
                  (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as a
                  special case, and overcomes this limitation. This
                  paper introduces algorithms for performing Bayesian
                  inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An
                  important requirement for inference is the
                  specification of the distribution over parameters of
                  the models. We introduce a new distribution for
                  covariance matrices of Gaussian DMGs. We discuss and
                  illustrate how several Bayesian machine learning
                  tasks can benefit from the principle presented here:
                  the power to model dependencies that are generated
                  from hidden variables, but without necessarily
                  modeling such variables explicitly.}

                  role in learning with graphical models. One way of
                  parameterizing a model of marginal independencies is
                  by building a latent variable model where two
                  independent observed variables have no common latent
                  source. In sparse domains, however, it might be
                  advantageous to model the marginal observed
                  distribution directly, without explicitly including
                  latent variables in the model.  There have been
                  recent advances in Gaussian and binary models of
                  marginal independence, but no models with non-linear
                  dependencies between continuous variables has been

                  generalize the Gaussian model of marginal
                  independencies based on mixtures, and how to learn

                  addresses the question: is the relation between
                  objects A and B analogous to those relations found
                  in S? We recast this classi- cal problem as a
                  problem of Bayesian analy- sis of relational
                  data. This problem is non- trivial because direct
                  similarity between ob- jects is not a good way of
                  measuring analo- gies. For instance, the analogy
                  between an electron around the nucleus of an atom
                  and a planet around the Sun is hardly justified by
                  isolated, non-relational, comparisons of an electron
                  to a planet, and a nucleus to the Sun. We develop a
                  generative model for predicting the existence of
                  relationships and extend the framework of Ghahramani
                  and Heller (2005) to provide a Bayesian measure for
                  how analogous a relation is to other relations. This
                  sheds new light on an old problem, which we motivate
                  and illustrate through practical applications in
                  exploratory data analysis.}

                  the performance of Gaussian Process (GP) models, as
                  the chosen kernel determines both the inductive
                  biases and prior support of functions under the GP
                  prior. This work addresses the challenge of
                  constructing custom kernel functions for
                  high-dimensional GP regression models. Drawing
                  inspiration from recent progress in deep learning,
                  we introduce a novel approach named KITT: Kernel
                  Identification Through Transformers. KITT exploits a
                  transformer-based architecture to generate kernel
                  recommendations in under 0.1 seconds, which is
                  several orders of magnitude faster than conventional
                  kernel search algorithms. We train our model using
                  synthetic data generated from priors over a
                  vocabulary of known kernels. By exploiting the
                  nature of the self-attention mechanism, KITT is able
                  to process datasets with inputs of arbitrary
                  dimension. We demonstrate that kernels chosen by
                  KITT yield strong performance over a diverse
                  collection of regression benchmarks.}

                  using the well-known unit quaternion as state
                  (q-IEKF) while the other is using orientation
                  deviation which we call IMEKF. The third method is
                  based on nonlinear least squares (NLS) estimation of
                  the angular velocity which is used to parametrise
                  the orientation. The results are obtained using

                  a new approximation method for speeding up GP
                  regression in the case of a large number of data
                  points N. The approximation is controlled by the
                  gradient optimization of a small set of M
                  pseudo-inputs, thereby reducing complexity from
                  O(N<sup>3</sup>) to O(NM<sup>2</sup>). One
                  limitation of the SPGP is that this optimization
                  space becomes impractically big for high dimensional
                  data sets. This paper addresses this limitation by
                  performing automatic dimensionality reduction. A
                  projection of the input space to a low dimensional
                  space is learned in a supervised manner, alongside
                  the pseudo-inputs, which now live in this reduced
                  space. The paper also investigates the suitability
                  of the SPGP for modeling data with input-dependent
                  noise. A further extension of the model is made to
                  make it even more powerful in this regard - we learn
                  an uncertainty parameter for each pseudo-input. The
                  combination of sparsity, reduced dimension, and
                  input-dependent noise makes it possible to apply GPs
                  to much larger and more complex data sets than was
                  previously practical. We demonstrate the benefits of
                  these methods on several synthetic and real world

                  probabilistic nonparametric models for regression,

                  suffer from computational intractability for large
                  data sets. Over the past decade there have been many
                  different approximations developed to reduce this
                  cost. Most of these can be termed global
                  approximations, in that they try to summarize all
                  the training data via a small set of support
                  points. A different approach is that of local
                  regression, where many local experts account for
                  their own part of space. In this paper we start by
                  investigating the regimes in which these different
                  approaches work well or fail. We then proceed to
                  develop a new sparse GP approximation which is a

                  local ancestry estimation ignore the latent genetic
                  relatedness between ancestral populations and treat
                  them as independent. In this paper, we exploit such
                  information by building an inheritance model that
                  describes both the ancestral populations and the
                  admixed population jointly in a unified
                  framework. Based on an assumption that the common
                  hypothetical founder haplotypes give rise to both
                  the ancestral and admixed population haplotypes, we
                  employ an infinite hidden Markov model to
                  characterize each ancestral population and further
                  extend it to generate the admixed
                  population. Through an effective utilization of the
                  population structural information under a principled
                  nonparametric Bayesian framework, the resulting
                  model is significantly less sensitive to the choice
                  and the amount of training data for ancestral
                  populations than state-of-the-arts algorithms. We
                  also improve the robustness under deviation from
                  common modeling assumptions by incorporating
                  population-specific scale parameters that allow
                  variable recombination rates in different

                  population from an arbitrary number of ancestral
                  populations and also performs competitively in terms
                  of spurious ancestry proportions under general
                  multi-way admixture assumption. We validate the
                  proposed method by simulation under various admixing

                  received considerable attention. Prior work largely
                  focuses on defining conditions for fairness, but
                  does not define satisfactory measures of algorithmic
                  unfairness. In this paper, we focus on the following
                  question: Given two unfair algorithms, how should we
                  determine which of the two is more unfair? Our core
                  idea is to use existing inequality indices from
                  economics to measure how unequally the outcomes of
                  an algorithm benefit different individuals or groups
                  in a population.  Our work offers a justified and
                  general framework to compare and contrast the
                  (un)fairness of algorithmic predictors. This
                  unifying approach enables us to quantify unfairness
                  both at the individual and the group level. Further,
                  our work reveals overlooked tradeoffs between
                  different fairness notions: using our proposed
                  measures, the overall individual-level unfairness of
                  an algorithm can be decomposed into a between-group
                  and a within-group component. Earlier methods are
                  typically designed to tackle only between-group
                  unfairness, which may be justified for legal or
                  other reasons. However, we demonstrate that
                  minimizing exclusively the between-group component
                  may, in fact, increase the within-group, and hence
                  the overall unfairness. We characterize and
                  illustrate the tradeoffs between our measures of
                  (un)fairness and the prediction accuracy.},

                  data generation is expensive and can be restricted
                  for ethical reasons (eg in vivo experiments). A
                  widely applied technique in early drug discovery to
                  identify novel active molecules against a protein
                  target is modelling quantitative structure-activity
                  relationships (QSAR). It is known to be extremely
                  challenging, as available measurements of compound
                  activities range in the low dozens or
                  hundreds. However, many such related datasets exist,
                  each with a small number of datapoints, opening up
                  the opportunity for few-shot learning after
                  pre-training on a substantially larger corpus of
                  data. At the same time, many few-shot learning
                  methods are currently evaluated in the
                  computer-vision domain.  We propose that expansion
                  into a new application, as well as the possibility
                  to use explicitly graph-structured data, will drive
                  exciting progress in few-shot learning. Here, we
                  provide a few-shot learning dataset (FS-Mol) and
                  complementary benchmarking procedure.  We define a
                  set of tasks on which few-shot learning methods can
                  be evaluated, with a separate set of tasks for use
                  in pre-training. In addition, we implement and
                  evaluate a number of existing single-task,
                  multi-task, and meta-learning approaches as
                  baselines for the community.  We hope that our
                  dataset, support code release, and baselines will
                  encourage future work on this extremely challenging
                  new domain for few-shot learning.}

                  algorithms for multisets of sequences, taking
                  advantage of the multiset's unordered structure.
                  Multisets are a generalisation of sets where members
                  are allowed to occur multiple times.  A multiset can
                  be encoded naively by simply storing its elements in
                  some sequential order, but then information is
                  wasted on the ordering.  We propose a technique that
                  transforms the multiset into an order-invariant tree
                  representation, and derive an arithmetic code that
                  optimally compresses the tree. Our method achieves
                  compression even if the sequences in the multiset
                  are individually incompressible (such as
                  cryptographic hash sums). The algorithm is
                  demonstrated practically by compressing collections
                  of SHA-1 hash sums, and multisets of arbitrary,
                  individually encodable objects. },

                  derive an estimate of parameters from this
                  distribution. Our approach differs from the Bayesian

                  variables from the U-likelihood. This algorithm
                  captures some of the correlations among hidden

                  reaction terms are found to penalize the
                  likelihood. We show that the U-updating algorithm
                  becomes the EM algorithm as a special case in the
                  large sample limit. The useful behavior of our

                  Gaussians by comparing to the EM algorithm.}

                  inference. In this paper, we introduce a more
                  general approximate inference framework for
                  conjugate-exponential family models, which we call
                  Latent-Space Variational Bayes (LSVB). In this
                  approach, we integrate out the model parameters in
                  an exact way, leaving only the latent variables. It
                  can be shown that the LSVB approach gives better
                  estimates of the model evidence as well as the
                  distribution over the latent variables than the VBEM
                  approach, but, in practice, the distribution over
                  the latent variables has to be approximated. As a
                  practical implementation, we present a First-order
                  LSVB (FoLSVB) algorithm to approximate the
                  distribution over the latent variables. From this
                  approximate distribution, one can also estimate the
                  model evidence and the posterior over the model
                  parameters. The FoLSVB algorithm is directly
                  comparable to the VBEM algorithm and has the same
                  computational complexity. We discuss how LSVB
                  generalizes the recently proposed collapsed
                  variational methods to general conjugate-exponential
                  families. Examples based on mixtures of Gaussians
                  and mixtures of Bernoullis with synthetic and
                  real-world data sets are used to illustrate some
                  advantages of our method over VBEM.}

                  unsupervised motion segmentation. Second, generative
                  models are trained on the masks of the background

  abstract =	 { This thesis concerns the use of Gaussian processes
                  (GPs) as distributions over unknown functions in
                  Machine Learning and probabilistic modeling. GPs
                  have been found to have utility in a wide range of
                  applications owing to their flexibility,
                  interpretability, and tractability. I advance their
                  use in three directions.  Firstly, the abstractions
                  upon which software is built for their use in
                  practice. In modern GP software libraries such as
                  GPML, GPy, GPflow, and GPyTorch, the kernel is
                  undoubtedly the dominant abstraction. While it
                  remains highly successful it of course has
                  limitations, and I propose to address some of these
                  through a complementary abstraction: affine
                  transformations of GPs.  Specifically I show how a
                  collection of GPs, and affine transformations
                  thereof, can themselves be treated as a single GP.
                  This in turn leads to a design for software,
                  including exact and approximate inference
                  algorithms. I demonstrate the utility of this
                  software through a collection of worked examples,
                  focussing on models which are more cleanly and
                  easily expressed using this new software.  Secondly,
                  I develop a new scalable approximate inference
                  algorithm for a class of GPs commonly utilised in
                  spatio-temporal problems.  This is a setting in
                  which GPs excel, for example enabling the
                  incorporation of important inductive biases, and
                  observations made at arbitrary points in time and
                  space. However, the computation required to perform
                  exact inference and learning in GPs scales cubically
                  in the number of observations, necessitating
                  approximation, to which end I combine two important
                  complementary classes of approximation: pseudo-point
                  and Markovian. The key contribution is the insight
                  that a simple and useful way to combine them turns
                  out to be well-justified. This resolves an open
                  question in the literature, provides new insight
                  into existing work, and a new family of
                  approximations. The efficacy of an important member
                  of this family is demonstrated empirically.  Finally
                  I develop a GP model and associated approximate
                  inference techniques for the prediction of sea
                  surface temperatures (SSTs) on decadal time scales,
                  which are relevant when taking planning decisions
                  which consider resilience to climate change. There
                  remains a large degree of uncertainty as to the
                  state of the climate on such time scales, but it is
                  thought to be possible to reduce this by exploiting
                  the predictability of natural variability in the
                  climate. The developed GP-based model incorporates a
                  key assumption used by the existing statistical
                  models employed for decadal prediction, thus
                  retaining a valuable inductive bias, while offering
                  several advantages. Amongst these is the lack of
                  need for spatial aggregation of data, which is
                  especially relevant when data are sparse, as is the
                  case with historical ocean SST data.  In summary,
                  this thesis contributes to the practical use of GPs
                  through a set of abstractions that are useful in the
                  design of software, algorithms for approximate
                  inference in spatial-temporal settings, and their
                  use in decadal climate prediction.  }

                  GP approximations do not simultaneously support
                  large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points
                  and long time-series which is a hallmark of many
                  applications. Pseudo-point approximations, one of
                  the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs to large
                  data sets, are well suited for handling off-the-grid
                  spatial data. However, they cannot handle long
                  temporal observation horizons effectively reverting
                  to cubic computational scaling in the time
                  dimension.  State space GP approximations are well
                  suited to handling temporal data, if the temporal GP
                  prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear
                  complexity in the number of temporal observations,
                  but have a cubic spatial cost and cannot handle
                  off-the-grid spatial data.  In this work we show
                  that there is a simple and elegant way to combine
                  pseudo-point methods with the state space GP
                  approximation framework to get the best of both
                  worlds. The approach hinges on a surprising
                  conditional independence property which applies to
                  space‚Äìtime separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically
                  that the combined approach is more scalable and
                  applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal
                  problems than either method on its own.  }

                  models. We propose a new algorithm, whose parameter
                  updates rely on two forces: a regular gradient step,
                  and a corrective direction dictated by the currently
                  best-performing worker (leader). Our method differs
                  from the parameter-averaging scheme EASGD in a
                  number of ways: (i) our objective formulation does
                  not change the location of stationary points
                  compared to the original optimization problem; (ii)
                  we avoid convergence decelerations caused by pulling
                  local workers descending to different local minima
                  to each other (i.e. to the average of their
                  parameters); (iii) our update by design breaks the
                  curse of symmetry (the phenomenon of being trapped
                  in poorly generalizing sub-optimal solutions in
                  symmetric non-convex landscapes); and (iv) our
                  approach is more communication efficient since it
                  broadcasts only parameters of the leader rather than
                  all workers. We provide theoretical analysis of the
                  batch version of the proposed algorithm, which we
                  call Leader Gradient Descent (LGD), and its
                  stochastic variant (LSGD). Finally, we implement an
                  asynchronous version of our algorithm and extend it
                  to the multi-leader setting, where we form groups of
                  workers, each represented by its own local leader
                  (the best performer in a group), and update each
                  worker with a corrective direction comprised of two
                  attractive forces: one to the local, and one to the
                  global leader (the best performer among all
                  workers). The multi-leader setting is well-aligned
                  with current hardware architecture, where local
                  workers forming a group lie within a single
                  computational node and different groups correspond
                  to different nodes. For training convolutional
                  neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that our
                  approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art
                  baselines.}

                  performance to further improve stability. We
                  evaluate the proposed techniques on a number of
                  examples, showing that, in geospatial settings,

  abstract =	 {This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the
                  simultaneous mapping and localization (SLAM)
                  problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a
                  static environment with a mobile robot. The vast
                  majority of SLAM algorithms are based on the
                  extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates
                  an algorithm that relies on the dual of the EKF, the
                  extended information filter (EIF). We show that when
                  represented in the information form, map posteriors
                  are dominated by a small number of links that tie
                  together nearby features in the map. This insight is
                  developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called
                  the sparse extended information filters
                  (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks
                  of features that are locally interconnected, where
                  links represent relative information between pairs
                  of nearby features, as well as information about the
                  robot's pose relative to the map. We show that all
                  essential update equations in SEIFs can be executed
                  in constant time, irrespective of the size of the
                  map. We also provide empirical results obtained for
                  a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor
                  environment, and using a multi-robot mapping
                  simulation.  }

                  (GPCM), a two-stage nonparametric generative
                  procedure to model stationary signals as the
                  convolution between a continuous-time white-noise
                  process and a continuous-time linear filter drawn
                  from Gaussian process. The GPCM is a continuous-time
                  nonparametricwindow moving average process and,
                  conditionally, is itself a Gaussian process with a
                  nonparametric kernel defined in a probabilistic
                  fashion. The generative model can be equivalently
                  considered in the frequency domain, where the power
                  spectral density of the signal is specified using a
                  Gaussian process.  One of the main contributions of
                  the paper is to develop a novel variational
                  freeenergy approach based on inter-domain inducing
                  variables that efficiently learns the
                  continuous-time linear filter and infers the driving
                  white-noise process. In turn, this scheme provides
                  closed-form probabilistic estimates of the
                  covariance kernel and the noise-free signal both in
                  denoising and prediction scenarios. Additionally,
                  the variational inference procedure provides
                  closed-form expressions for the approximate
                  posterior of the spectral density given the observed
                  data, leading to new Bayesian nonparametric
                  approaches to spectrum estimation. The proposed GPCM

                  parametrized using reproducing kernels. The nature
                  of SSMs requires learning a latent function that
                  resides in the state space and for which

                  prohibiting the use of gradient-based supervised

                  real-valued multikernel approach) for general

                  modelling complex signals, as they are designed in

                  each dataset, and a part generic to, and therefore
                  shared between, all the considered source sets.
                  This allows us to use the generic representation as
                  un-biased reference knowledge for a novel
                  classification task. By casting the method in the

                  classically treated as separate and consecutive
                  tasks: one first infers the causal graph, and then
                  uses it to estimate causal effects of
                  interventions. However, such a two-stage approach is
                  uneconomical, especially in terms of actively
                  collected interventional data, since the causal
                  query of interest may not require a fully-specified
                  causal model. From a Bayesian perspective, it is
                  also unnatural, since a causal query (e.g., the
                  causal graph or some causal effect) can be viewed as
                  a latent quantity subject to posterior inference --
                  other unobserved quantities that are not of direct
                  interest (e.g., the full causal model) ought to be
                  marginalized out in this process and contribute to
                  our epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose
                  Active Bayesian Causal Inference (ABCI), a
                  fully-Bayesian active learning framework for
                  integrated causal discovery and reasoning, which
                  jointly infers a posterior over causal models and
                  queries of interest. In our approach to ABCI, we
                  focus on the class of causally-sufficient, nonlinear
                  additive noise models, which we model using Gaussian
                  processes. We sequentially design experiments that
                  are maximally informative about our target causal
                  query, collect the corresponding interventional
                  data, and update our beliefs to choose the next
                  experiment. Through simulations, we demonstrate that
                  our approach is more data-efficient than several
                  baselines that only focus on learning the full
                  causal graph. This allows us to accurately learn
                  downstream causal queries from fewer samples while
                  providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for
                  the quantities of interest.},

                  enforce restrictive assumptions on the data
                  distribution, recent work has managed to learn
                  semi-supervised models in a non-restrictive regime.
                  However, so far such approaches have only been
                  proposed for linear models.  In this work, we
                  introduce semi-supervised parameter learning for
                  Sum-Product Networks (SPNs).  SPNs are deep
                  probabilistic models admitting inference in linear
                  time in number of network edges. Our approach has
                  several advantages, as it (1) allows generative and

                  guarantees that adding unlabelled data can increase,

                  show on a variety of data sets that safe
                  semi-supervised learning with SPNs is competitive

                  estimators and have received significant attention
                  due to their attractive inference properties. While
                  parameter learning in SPNs is well developed,
                  structure learning leaves something to be desired:
                  Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure
                  learners, most of them are somewhat ad-hoc and based
                  on intuition rather than a clear learning
                  principle. In this paper, we introduce a
                  well-principled Bayesian framework for SPN structure
                  learning. First, we decompose the problem into i)
                  laying out a computational graph, and ii) learning
                  the so-called scope function over the graph. The
                  first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural
                  network architecture validation. The second
                  represents the effective structure of the SPN and
                  needs to respect the usual structural constraints in
                  SPN, i.e. completeness and decomposability. While
                  representing and learning the scope function is
                  somewhat involved in general, in this paper, we
                  propose a natural parametrisation for an important
                  and widely used special case of SPNs. These
                  structural parameters are incorporated into a
                  Bayesian model, such that simultaneous structure and
                  parameter learning is cast into monolithic Bayesian
                  posterior inference. In various experiments, our
                  Bayesian SPNs often improve test likelihoods over
                  greedy SPN learners. Further, since the Bayesian
                  framework protects against overfitting, we can
                  evaluate hyper-parameters directly on the Bayesian
                  model score, waiving the need for a separate
                  validation set, which is especially beneficial in
                  low data regimes. Bayesian SPNs can be applied to
                  heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to
                  nonparametric formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian
                  approach is the first, which consistently and
                  robustly learns SPN structures under missing data.}

  abstract =	 {Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric
                  Bayesian regression models that allow exact
                  posterior inference, but exhibit high computational
                  and memory costs. In order to improve scalability of
                  GPs, approximate posterior inference is frequently
                  employed, where a prominent class of approximation
                  techniques is based on local GP experts. However,
                  local-expert techniques proposed so far are either
                  not well-principled, come with limited approximation
                  guarantees, or lead to intractable models. In this
                  paper, we introduce deep structured mixtures of GP
                  experts, a stochastic process model which i) allows
                  exact posterior inference, ii) has attractive
                  computational and memory costs, and iii) when used
                  as GP approximation, captures predictive
                  uncertainties consistently better than previous
                  expert-based approximations. In a variety of
                  experiments, we show that deep structured mixtures
                  have a low approximation error and often perform
                  competitive or outperform prior work.}

  abstract =	 {When machine learning systems meet real world
                  applications, accuracy is only one of several
                  requirements. In this paper, we assay a
                  complementary perspective originating from the
                  increasing availability of pre-trained and regularly
                  improving state-of-the-art models. While new
                  improved models develop at a fast pace, downstream
                  tasks vary more slowly or stay constant. Assume that
                  we have a large unlabelled data set for which we
                  want to maintain accurate predictions. Whenever a
                  new and presumably better ML models becomes
                  available, we encounter two problems: (i) given a
                  limited budget, which data points should be
                  re-evaluated using the new model?; and (ii) if the
                  new predictions differ from the current ones, should
                  we update? Problem (i) is about compute cost, which
                  matters for very large data sets and models. Problem
                  (ii) is about maintaining consistency of the
                  predictions, which can be highly relevant for
                  downstream applications; our demand is to avoid
                  negative flips, i.e., changing correct to incorrect
                  predictions. In this paper, we formalize the
                  Prediction Update Problem and present an efficient
                  probabilistic approach as answer to the above
                  questions. In extensive experiments on standard
                  classification benchmark data sets, we show that our
                  method outperforms alternative strategies along key
                  metrics for backward-compatible prediction updates.},

                  attention from the machine learning community. It is
                  important that the field is aware of the actual
                  goals and challenges of drug design and the roles
                  that de novo molecule design algorithms could play
                  in accelerating the process, so that algorithms can
                  be evaluated in a way that reflects how they would
                  be applied in real drug design scenarios. In this
                  paper, we propose a framework for critically
                  assessing the merits of benchmarks, and argue that
                  most of the existing de novo drug design benchmark
                  functions are either highly unrealistic or depend
                  upon a surrogate model whose performance is not well
                  characterized. In order for the field to achieve its
                  long-term goals, we recommend that poor benchmarks
                  (especially logP and QED) be deprecated in favour of
                  better benchmarks. We hope that our proposed
                  framework can play a part in developing new de novo
                  drug design benchmarks that are more realistic and
                  ideally incorporate the intrinsic goals of drug
                  design.}

                  difficult.  In this paper, we present an

  school =	 {Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, UCL},
  year =	 2010,
  abstract =	 {It is important to understand the rich structure of
                  natural sounds in order to solve important tasks,
                  like automatic speech recognition, and to understand
                  auditory processing in the brain. This thesis takes
                  a step in this direction by characterising the
                  statistics of simple natural sounds. We focus on the
                  statistics because perception often appears to
                  depend on them, rather than on the raw waveform. For
                  example the perception of auditory textures, like
                  running water, wind, fire and rain, depends on
                  summary-statistics, like the rate of falling rain
                  droplets, rather than on the exact details of the
                  physical source.  In order to analyse the statistics
                  of sounds accurately it is necessary to improve a
                  number of traditional signal processing methods,
                  including those for amplitude demodulation,
                  time-frequency analysis, and sub-band
                  demodulation. These estimation tasks are ill-posed
                  and therefore it is natural to treat them as
                  Bayesian inference problems. The new probabilistic
                  versions of these methods have several
                  advantages. For example, they perform more
                  accurately on natural signals and are more robust to
                  noise, they can also fill-in missing sections of
                  data, and provide error-bars. Furthermore,
                  free-parameters can be learned from the signal.
                  Using these new algorithms we demonstrate that the
                  energy, sparsity, modulation depth and modulation
                  time-scale in each sub-band of a signal are critical
                  statistics, together with the dependencies between
                  the sub-band modulators. In order to validate this
                  claim, a model containing co-modulated coloured
                  noise carriers is shown to be capable of generating
                  a range of realistic sounding auditory textures.
                  Finally, we explored the connection between the
                  statistics of natural sounds and perception. We
                  demonstrate that inference in the model for auditory
                  textures qualitatively replicates the primitive
                  grouping rules that listeners use to understand
                  simple acoustic scenes. This suggests that the
                  auditory system is optimised for the statistics of
                  natural sounds.},

                  using Gaussian processes in time series
                  problems. These are extended to the state space
                  approach to time series in two different problems.
                  We also combine Gaussian processes and Bayesian
                  online change point detection (BOCPD) to increase
                  the generality of the Gaussian process time series
                  methods. These methodologies are evaluated on
                  predictive performance on six real world data sets,
                  which include three environmental data sets, one
                  financial, one biological, and one from industrial
                  well drilling.<br> Gaussian processes are capable of
                  generalizing standard linear time series models. We
                  cover two approaches: the Gaussian process time
                  series model (GPTS) and the autoregressive Gaussian
                  process (ARGP).  We cover a variety of methods that
                  greatly reduce the computational and memory
                  complexity of Gaussian process approaches, which are
                  generally cubic in computational complexity.<br> Two
                  different improvements to state space based
                  approaches are covered.  First, Gaussian process
                  inference and learning (GPIL) generalizes linear
                  dynamical systems (LDS), for which the Kalman filter
                  is based, to general nonlinear systems for
                  nonparametric system identification. Second, we
                  address pathologies in the unscented Kalman filter
                  (UKF). We use Gaussian process optimization (GPO) to
                  learn UKF settings that minimize the potential for
                  sigma point collapse.<br> We show how to embed
                  mentioned Gaussian process approaches to time series
                  into a change point framework. Old data, from an old
                  regime, that hinders predictive performance is
                  automatically and elegantly phased out. The
                  computational improvements for Gaussian process time
                  series approaches are of even greater use in the
                  change point framework. We also present a supervised
                  framework learning a change point model when change
                  point labels are available in training.<br> These
                  mentioned methodologies significantly improve

                  respect to the parameters of some underlying
                  prediction model (UPM). Furthermore, it is often
                  desirable to adapt the UPM to incoming regime
                  changes as soon as possible, necessitating
                  sequential inference about change point locations. A
                  Bayesian algorithm for online change point detection
                  (BOCPD) has been introduced recently by Adams and
                  MacKay (2007).  In this algorithm, uncertainty about
                  the last change point location is updated
                  sequentially, and is integrated out to make online
                  predictions robust to parameter changes. BOCPD
                  requires a set of fixed hyper-parameters which allow
                  the user to fully specify the hazard function for
                  change points and the prior distribution over the
                  parameters of the UPM.  In practice, finding the
                  "right" hyper-parameters can be quite difficult. We
                  therefore extend BOCPD by introducing
                  hyper-parameter learning, without sacrificing the
                  online nature of the algorithm.  Hyper-parameter
                  learning is performed by optimizing the marginal
                  likelihood of the BOCPD model, a closed-form
                  quantity which can be computed sequentially. We
                  illustrate performance on three real-world

                  challenging. One approach, perhaps that adopted by
                  the brain, is to shape useful representations of
                  sounds on prior knowledge about their statistical
                  structure.  For example, sounds with harmonic
                  sections are common and so time-frequency
                  representations are efficient. Most current
                  representations concentrate on the shorter
                  components. Here, we propose representations for
                  structures on longer time-scales, like the phonemes
                  and sentences of speech. We decompose a sound into a
                  product of processes, each with its own
                  characteristic time-scale. This demodulation cascade
                  relates to classical amplitude demodulation, but
                  traditional algorithms fail to realise the
                  representation fully. A new approach, probabilistic
                  amplitude demodulation, is shown to out-perform the
                  established methods, and to easily extend to
                  representation of a full demodulation cascade.},

  abstract =	 {Natural sounds are structured on many time-scales. A
                  typical segment of speech, for example, contains
                  features that span four orders of magnitude:
                  Sentences ($\sim1$s); phonemes ($\sim10$‚àí$1$ s);
                  glottal pulses ($\sim 10$‚àí$2$s); and formants ($\sim
                  10$‚àí$3$s).  The auditory system uses information
                  from each of these time-scales to solve complicated
                  tasks such as auditory scene analysis [1]. One route
                  toward understanding how auditory processing
                  accomplishes this analysis is to build
                  neuroscience-inspired algorithms which solve similar
                  tasks and to compare the properties of these
                  algorithms with properties of auditory
                  processing. There is however a discord: Current
                  machine-audition algorithms largely concentrate on
                  the shorter time-scale structures in sounds, and the
                  longer structures are ignored. The reason for this
                  is two-fold. Firstly, it is a difficult technical
                  problem to construct an algorithm that utilises both
                  sorts of information. Secondly, it is
                  computationally demanding to simultaneously process
                  data both at high resolution (to extract short
                  temporal information) and for long duration (to
                  extract long temporal information). The contribution
                  of this work is to develop a new statistical model
                  for natural sounds that captures structure across a
                  wide range of time-scales, and to provide efficient
                  learning and inference algorithms. We demonstrate
                  the success of this approach on a missing data
                  task.},

                  methods fill an important middle ground, retaining
                  distributional information about uncertainty in
                  latent variables, unlike maximum a posteriori
                  methods (MAP), and yet generally requiring less
                  computational time than Monte Carlo Markov Chain
                  methods. In particular the variational Expectation
                  Maximisation (vEM) and variational Bayes algorithms,
                  both involving variational optimisation of a
                  free-energy, are widely used in time-series
                  modelling. Here, we investigate the success of vEM
                  in simple probabilistic time-series models. First we
                  consider the inference step of vEM, and show that a
                  consequence of the well-known compactness property
                  of variational inference is a failure to propagate
                  uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of
                  the retained distributional information. In
                  particular, the uncertainty may appear to be
                  smallest precisely when the approximation is
                  poorest. Second, we consider parameter learning and
                  analytically reveal systematic biases in the
                  parameters found by vEM. Surprisingly, simpler
                  variational approximations (such a mean-field) can
                  lead to less bias than more complicated structured
                  approximations.},

                  unknown. Here, we approach this problem using the
                  methods of probabilistic inference. The new
                  approach, called Probabilistic Amplitude
                  Demodulation (PAD), is computationally challenging
                  but improves on existing methods in a number of
                  ways. By contrast to previous approaches to
                  demodulation, it satisfies five key desiderata: PAD
                  has soft constraints because it is probabilistic;
                  PAD is able to automatically adjust to the signal
                  because it learns parameters; PAD is user-steerable
                  because the solution can be shaped by user-specific
                  prior information; PAD is robust to broad-band noise
                  because this is modelled explicitly; and PAD‚Äôs
                  solution is self-consistent, empirically satisfying
                  a Carrier Identity property.  Furthermore, the
                  probabilistic view naturally encompasses noise and
                  uncertainty, allowing PAD to cope with missing data
                  and return error bars on carrier and envelope
                  estimates. Finally, we show that when PAD is applied
                  to a bandpass-filtered signal, the stop-band energy
                  of the inferred carrier is minimal, making PAD
                  well-suited to sub-band demodulation.},

                  quickly varying carrier whose instantaneous
                  frequency also varies slowly over time. Although
                  signal processing provides algorithms for so-called

                  are well known problems with all of the existing

                  theoretical neuroscience is to work out how it does
                  so. One proposed feature extraction strategy is
                  motivated by the observation that the meaning of
                  sensory data, such as the identity of a moving
                  visual object, is often more persistent than the
                  activation of any single sensory receptor. This
                  notion is embodied in the slow feature analysis
                  (SFA) algorithm, which uses ‚Äúslowness‚Äù as an
                  heuristic by which to extract semantic information

                  local optima and model structure determination
                  problems. In this paper, we present a method for
                  simultaneously solving these problems based on the
                  variational Bayesian (VB) framework. First, in the
                  VB framework, we derive an objective function that
                  can simultaneously optimize both model parameter
                  distributions and model structure. Next, focusing on
                  mixture models, we present a deterministic algorithm
                  to approximately optimize the objective function by
                  using the idea of the split and merge operations
                  which we previously proposed within the maximum
                  likelihood framework. Then, we apply the method to
                  mixture of expers (MoE) models to experimentally
                  show that the proposed method can find the optimal
                  number of experts of a MoE while avoiding local
                  maxima. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights

                  we extend their scope towards unsupervised
                  representation learning: we encode samples into
                  continuous and categorical embeddings and show that
                  they can also be decoded back into the original
                  input space by leveraging MPE inference. We
                  characterize when this Sum-Product Autoencoding
                  (SPAE) leads to equivalent reconstructions and
                  extend it towards dealing with missing embedding

                  this trend will continue---are there any clear
                  failure cases for E2E training? We study this
                  question in depth, for the specific case of E2E
                  training an ensemble of networks. Our strategy is to
                  blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes:
                  from independent training of the networks, up to to
                  full E2E training.  We find clear failure cases,
                  where overparameterized models cannot be trained
                  E2E. A surprising result is that the optimum can
                  sometimes lie in between the two, neither an
                  ensemble or an E2E system. The work also uncovers
                  links to Dropout, and raises questions around the
                  nature of ensemble diversity and multi-branch
                  networks.},

                  reduce the problem to finding a maximum weight
                  stable set (MWSS) in a derived weighted graph,
                  which, if perfect, allows a solution to be found in

                  investigated the class of binary pairwise models
                  where this method may be applied. However, their
                  analysis made a seemingly innocuous assumption which
                  simplifies analysis but led to only a subset of
                  possible reparameterizations being considered. Here
                  we introduce novel techniques and consider all

                  new, arguably simpler proof from first
                  principles. We make use of the idea of clamping a
                  variable to a particular value. For an attractive
                  model, we show that summing over the Bethe partition
                  functions for each sub-model obtained after clamping
                  any variable can only raise (and hence improve) the

                  that may have other useful implications. Repeatedly
                  clamping until we obtain a model with no cycles,
                  where the Bethe approximation is exact, yields the

                  discovery and extrapolation without human
                  intervention.  Bayesian nonparametric models, which
                  can uniquely represent expressive prior information
                  and detailed inductive biases, provide a distinct
                  opportunity to develop intelligent systems, with
                  applications in essentially any learning and
                  prediction task.<br> Gaussian processes are rich
                  distributions over functions, which provide a
                  Bayesian nonparametric approach to smoothing and
                  interpolation.  A covariance kernel determines the
                  support and inductive biases of a Gaussian process.
                  In this thesis, we introduce new covariance kernels
                  to enable fast automatic pattern discovery and
                  extrapolation with Gaussian processes.<br> In the
                  introductory chapter, we discuss the high level
                  principles behind all of the models in this thesis:
                  1) we can typically improve the predictive
                  performance of a model by accounting for additional
                  structure in data; 2) to automatically discover rich
                  structure in data, a model must have large support
                  and the appropriate inductive biases; 3) we most
                  need expressive models for large datasets, which
                  typically provide more information for learning
                  structure, and 4) we can often exploit the existing
                  inductive biases (assumptions) or structure of a
                  model for scalable inference, without the need for
                  simplifying assumptions.<br> In the context of this
                  introduction, we then discuss, in chapter 2,
                  Gaussian processes as kernel machines, and my views
                  on the future of Gaussian process research.<br> In
                  chapter 3 we introduce the Gaussian process
                  regression network (GPRN) framework, a multi-output
                  Gaussian process method which scales to many output
                  variables, and accounts for input-dependent
                  correlations between the outputs.  Underlying the
                  GPRN is a highly expressive kernel, formed using an
                  adaptive mixture of latent basis functions in a
                  neural network like architecture.  The GPRN is
                  capable of discovering expressive structure in data.
                  We use the GPRN to model the time-varying expression
                  levels of 1000 genes, the spatially varying
                  concentrations of several distinct heavy metals, and
                  multivariate volatility (input dependent noise
                  covariances) between returns on equity indices and
                  currency exchanges, which is particularly valuable
                  for portfolio allocation.  We generalise the GPRN to
                  an adaptive network framework, which does not depend
                  on Gaussian processes or Bayesian nonparametrics;
                  and we outline applications for the adaptive network
                  in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy,
                  ensemble learning, and change-point modelling.<br>
                  In chapter 4 we introduce simple closed form kernel
                  for automatic pattern discovery and extrapolation.
                  These spectral mixture (SM) kernels are derived by
                  modelling the spectral densiy of a kernel (its
                  Fourier transform) using a scale-location Gaussian
                  mixture.  SM kernels form a basis for all stationary
                  covariances, and can be used as a drop-in
                  replacement for standard kernels, as they retain
                  simple and exact learning and inference procedures.
                  We use the SM kernel to discover patterns and
                  perform long range extrapolation on atmospheric CO2
                  trends and airline passenger data, as well as on
                  synthetic examples.  We also show that the SM kernel
                  can be used to automatically reconstruct several
                  standard covariances.  The SM kernel and the GPRN
                  are highly complementary; we show that using the SM
                  kernel with adaptive basis functions in a GPRN
                  induces an expressive prior over non-stationary
                  kernels.<br> In chapter 5 we introduce GPatt, a
                  method for fast multidimensional pattern
                  extrapolation, particularly suited to imge and movie
                  data.  Without human intervention -- no hand
                  crafting of kernel features, and no sophisticated
                  initialisation procedures -- we show that GPatt can
                  solve large scale pattern extrapolation, inpainting
                  and kernel discovery problems, including a problem
                  with 383,400 training points.  GPatt exploits the
                  structure of a spectral mixture product (SMP)
                  kernel, for fast yet exact inference procedures.  We
                  find that GPatt significantly outperforms popular
                  alternative scalable gaussian process methods in
                  speed and accuracy.  Moreover, we discover profound
                  differences between each of these methods,
                  suggesting expressive kernels, nonparametric
                  representations, and scalable inference which
                  exploits existing model structure are useful in
                  combination for modelling large scale
                  multidimensional patterns.<br> The models in this
                  dissertation have proven to be scalable and with
                  greatly enhanced predictive performance over the
                  alternatives: the extra structure being modelled is
                  an important part of a wide variety of real data --
                  including problems in econometrics, gene expression,

  abstract =	 {Gaussian processes are rich distributions over
                  functions, which provide a Bayesian nonparametric
                  approach to smoothing and interpolation.  We
                  introduce simple closed form kernels that can be
                  used with Gaussian processes to discover patterns
                  and enable extrapolation.  These kernels are derived
                  by modelling a spectral density -- the Fourier
                  transform of a kernel -- with a Gaussian mixture.
                  The proposed kernels support a broad class of
                  stationary covariances, but Gaussian process
                  inference remains simple and analytic.  We
                  demonstrate the proposed kernels by discovering
                  patterns and performing long range extrapolation on
                  synthetic examples, as well as atmospheric CO2
                  trends and airline passenger data.  We also show
                  that we can reconstruct standard covariances within
                  our framework.},

                  point is positively correlated with its proportion
                  within that data point. This might be an undesirable
                  assumption. For example, in topic modeling, a topic

                  procedures for NMR spectroscopy.  Specifically, we
                  use a weighted sum of trigonometric functions
                  undergoing exponential decay to model free induction
                  decay (FID) signals.  We discuss the challenges in
                  estimating the components of this general model --
                  amplitudes, phase shifts, frequencies, decay rates,
                  and noise variances -- and offer practical
                  solutions.  We compare with conventional Fourier
                  transform spectroscopy for estimating the relative
                  concentrations of chemicals in a mixture, using
                  synthetic and experimentally acquired FID signals.
                  We find the proposed model is particularly robust to
                  low signal to noise ratios (SNR), and overlapping
                  peaks in the Fourier transform of the FID, enabling
                  accurate predictions (e.g., 1\% error at low SNR)
                  which are not possible with conventional
                  spectroscopy (5\% error).},

                  is an important problem in the modeling of
                  multivariate financial data. However, some of the
                  most popular models suffer from a) overfitting
                  problems and multiple local optima, b) failure to
                  capture shifts in market conditions and c) large

                  introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing
                  covariances. Over-fitting and local optima are
                  avoided by following a Bayesian approach instead of
                  computing point estimates. Changes in market
                  conditions are captured by assuming a diffusion
                  process in parameter values, and finally
                  computationally efficient and scalable inference is
                  performed using particle filters.  Experiments with

                  model for clustering and for general nonparametric
                  Bayesian density estimation. Unfortunately, like in
                  many statistical models, exact inference in a DPM is
                  intractable, and approximate methods are needed to
                  perform efficient inference.  While most attention
                  in the literature has been placed on Markov chain
                  Monte Carlo (MCMC) [1, 2, 3], variational Bayesian
                  (VB) [4] and collapsed variational methods [5], [6]
                  recently introduced a novel class of approximation
                  for DPMs based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering
                  (BHC). These tree-based combinatorial approximations
                  efficiently sum over exponentially many ways of
                  partitioning the data and offer a novel lower bound
                  on the marginal likelihood of the DPM [6]. In this
                  paper we make the following contributions: (1) We
                  show empirically that the BHC lower bounds are
                  substantially tighter than the bounds given by VB
                  [4] and by collapsed variational methods [5] on
                  synthetic and real datasets. (2) We also show that
                  BHC offers a more accurate predictive performance on
                  these datasets. (3) We further improve the
                  tree-based lower bounds with an algorithm that
                  efficiently sums contributions from alternative
                  trees. (4) We present a fast approximate method for
                  BHC. Our results suggest that our combinatorial
                  approximate inference methods and lower bounds may
                  be useful not only in DPMs but in other models as
                  well.}

                  making in an ever expanding range of applications
                  has raised concerns about its potential unfairness
                  towards certain social groups. In this context, a
                  number of recent studies have focused on defining,
                  detecting, and removing unfairness from data-driven
                  decision systems. However, the existing notions of
                  fairness, based on parity (equality) in treatment or
                  outcomes for different social groups, tend to be
                  needlessly stringent, limiting the overall decision
                  making accuracy. In this paper, we draw inspiration
                  from the fair-division and envy-freeness literature

                  (dis)parity as compared to the other groups. Then,
                  we introduce tractable proxies to design convex
                  margin-based classifiers that satisfy these
                  preference-based notions of fairness. Finally, we
                  experiment with a variety of synthetic and
                  real-world datasets and show that preference-based
                  fairness allows for greater decision accuracy than

                  neural signal processing. Rich neural data sets
                  potentially containing evidence of interactions can
                  now be collected readily in the laboratory, but
                  existing analysis methods are often not sufficiently
                  sensitive and specific to reveal these
                  interactions. Generalized linear models offer a
                  platform for analyzing multi-electrode recordings of
                  neuronal spike train data. Here we suggest an
                  L1-regularized logistic regression model (L1L
                  method) to detect short-term (order of 3ms) neuronal
                  interactions. We estimate the parameters in this
                  model using a coordinate descent algorithm, and
                  determine the optimal tuning parameter using a
                  Bayesian Information Criterion. Simulation studies
                  show that in general the L1L method has better
                  sensitivities and specificities than those of the
                  traditional shuffle-corrected cross-correlogram
                  (covariogram) method. The L1L method is able to
                  detect excitatory interactions with both high
                  sensitivity and specificity with reasonably large
                  recordings, even when the magnitude of the
                  interactions is small; similar results hold for
                  inhibition given sufficiently high baseline firing
                  rates. Our study also suggests that the false
                  positives can be further removed by thresholding,
                  because their magnitudes are typically smaller than
                  true interactions. Simulations also show that the
                  L1L method is somewhat robust to partially observed

                  reaching arm movements. The results show that some
                  neurons interact differently depending on task
                  conditions. The stronger interactions detected with
                  our L1L method were also visible using the

                  that the framework is a generalization of standard

                  it can effectively model the shared structure among

                  latter achieved by minimising the mutual information
                  between the representation and the target. It has
                  broad applications, ranging from training fair

                  unsupervised learning with disentangled

                  mainly use adversarial training, which involves
                  training a neural network to estimate mutual
                  information or its proxy and thus is slow and

                  and analytically computable approximation to this
                  proxy metric, thereby removing the need of
                  constructing neural network-based mutual information
                  estimators. Compared to baselines, experiments on
                  algorithmic fairness, disentangled representation
                  learning and domain adaptation verify that our
                  method can more effectively remove unwanted

                  solving problems like clustering, density estimation
                  and topic modelling. These models make weak

                  for the DP and the HDP mixture model. The proposed
                  method is based on a variant of the slice sampler
                  for DPs. Since this sampler does not involve a
                  pre-determined truncation, the stationary
                  distribution of the sampling algorithm is
                  unbiased. We provide both local thread-level and
                  distributed machine-level parallel implementations
                  and study the performance of this sampler through an
                  extensive set of experiments on image and text
                  data. When compared to existing inference
                  algorithms, the proposed method exhibits
                  state-of-the-art accuracy and strong scalability
                  with up to 512 cores.}

  abstract =	 {Probabilistic programming promises to simplify and
                  democratize probabilistic machine learning, but
                  successful probabilistic programming systems require
                  flexible, generic and efficient inference
                  engines. In this work, we present a system called
                  Turing for building MCMC algorithms for
                  probabilistic programming inference. Turing has a
                  very simple syntax and makes full use of the
                  numerical capabilities in the Julia programming
                  language, including all implemented probability
                  distributions, and automatic differentiation. Turing
                  supports a wide range of popular Monte Carlo
                  algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC),
                  HMC with No-U-Turns (NUTS), Gibbs sampling,
                  sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle
                  MCMC (PMCMC) samplers. Most importantly, Turing
                  inference is composable: it combines MCMC operations
                  on subsets of variables, for example using a
                  combination of an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs
                  (PG) engine.  We explore several combinations of
                  inference methods with the aim of finding approaches
                  that are both efficient and universal,
                  i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic
                  models. NUTS‚Äîa popular variant of HMC that adapts
                  Hamiltonian simulation path length automatically,
                  although quite powerful for exploring differentiable
                  target distributions, is however not universal. We
                  identify some failure modes for the NUTS engine, and
                  demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete
                  variables) and NUTS (for continuous variables) can
                  be useful when the NUTS engine is either not
                  applicable, or simply does not work well. Our aim is
                  to present Turing and its composable inference
                  engines to the world and encourage other researchers
                  to build on this system to help advance the field of
                  probabilistic machine learning. }

                  method in Bayesian inference. Recently, Heng &amp;
                  Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings
                  for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a
                  generic parallelizable scheme for HMC. However, in
                  practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is
                  considered as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the
                  no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC, proposed
                  states are not limited to end-points as in
                  Metropolis HMC; instead points along the entire
                  trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we
                  establish couplings for multinomial HMC, based on
                  optimal transport for multinomial sampling in its
                  transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting
                  time ‚Äì the time it takes for the coupled chains to
                  meet ‚Äì based on the notion of local
                  contractivity. We evaluate our methods using three
                  targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic
                  regression and log-Gaussian Cox point
                  processes. Compared to Heng &amp; Jacob (2019),
                  coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller
                  meeting time, and is more robust to choices of step
                  sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows re-use of
                  existing adaptation methods for HMC. These
                  improvements together paves the way for a wider and
                  more practical use of coupled HMC methods. }
