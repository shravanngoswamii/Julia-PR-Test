    title: Differentially Private Database Release via Kernel Mean Embeddings
    abstract: We lay theoretical foundations for new database release mechanisms
        that allow third-parties to construct consistent estimators of population
        statistics, while ensuring that the privacy of each individual contributing
        to the database is protected. The proposed framework rests on two main
        ideas. First, releasing (an estimate of) the kernel mean embedding of
        the data generating random variable instead of the database itself still
        allows third-parties to construct consistent estimators of a wide class
        of population statistics. Second, the algorithm can satisfy the definition
        of differential privacy by basing the released kernel mean embedding on
        entirely synthetic data points, while controlling accuracy through the
        metric available in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We describe two
        instantiations of the proposed framework, suitable under different scenarios,
        and prove theoretical results guaranteeing differential privacy of the
        resulting algorithms and the consistency of estimators constructed from
        their outputs.
