    abstract: How do people determine which elements of a set are most representative
      of that set? We extend an existing Bayesian measure of representativeness, which
      indicates the representativeness of a sample from a distribution, to deﬁne a
      measure of the representativeness of an item to a set. We show that this measure
      is formally related to a machine learning method known as Bayesian Sets. Building
      on this connection, we derive an analytic expression for the representativeness
      of objects described by a sparse vector of binary features. We then apply this
      measure to a large database of images, using it to determine which images are
      the most representative members of different sets. Comparing the resulting predictions
      to human judgments of representativeness provides a test of this measure with
      naturalistic stimuli, and illustrates how databases that are more commonly used
      in computer vision and machine learning can be used to evaluate psychological
      theories.

    abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL), is classification where additional unlabeled
      data can be used to improve accuracy. Generative approaches are appealing in
      this situation, as a model of the data's probability density can assist in identifying
      clusters. Nonparametric Bayesian methods, while ideal in theory due to their
      principled motivations, have been difficult to apply to SSL in practice. We
      present a nonparametric Bayesian method that uses Gaussian processes for the
      generative model, avoiding many of the problems associated with Dirichlet process
      mixture models. Our model is fully generative and we take advantage of recent
      advances in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms to provide a practical inference
      method. Our method compares favorably to competing approaches on synthetic and
      real-world multi-class data.

    abstract: Many data are naturally modeled by an unobserved hierarchical structure.
      In this paper we propose a flexible nonparametric prior over unknown data hierarchies.
      The approach uses nested stick-breaking processes to allow for trees of unbounded
      width and depth, where data can live at any node and are infinitely exchangeable.
      One can view our model as providing infinite mixtures where the components have
      a dependency structure corresponding to an evolutionary diffusion down a tree.
      By using a stick-breaking approach, we can apply Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
      based on slice sampling to perform Bayesian inference and simulate from the
      posterior distribution on trees. We apply our method to hierarchical clustering
      of images and topic modeling of text data.

    abstract: Tree structured belief networks are attractive for image segmentation
      tasks. However, networks with fixed architectures are not very suitable as they
      lead to blocky artefacts, and led to the introduction of dynamic trees (DTs).
      The Dynamic trees architecture provide a prior distribution over tree structures,
      and simulated annealing (SA) was used to search for structures with high posterior
      probability. In this paper we introduce a mean field approach to inference in
      DTs. We find that the mean field method captures the posterior better than just
      using the maximum a posteriori solution found by SA

    abstract: Deep belief networks are a powerful way to model complex probability
      distributions. However, it is difficult to learn the structure of a belief network,
      particularly one with hidden units. The Indian buffet process has been used
      as a nonparametric Bayesian prior on the structure of a directed belief network
      with a single infinitely wide hidden layer. Here, we introduce the cascading
      Indian buffet process (CIBP), which provides a prior on the structure of a layered,
      directed belief network that is unbounded in both depth and width, yet allows
      tractable inference. We use the CIBP prior with the nonlinear Gaussian belief
      network framework to allow each unit to vary its behavior between discrete and
      continuous representations. We use Markov chain Monte Carlo for inference in
      this model and explore the structures learned on image data.

    abstract: Interpretability of representations in both deep generative and discriminative
      models is highly desirable. Current methods jointly optimize an objective combining
      accuracy and interpretability. However, this may reduce accuracy, and is not
      applicable to already trained models. We propose two interpretability frameworks.
      First, we provide an interpretable lens for an existing model. We use a generative
      model which takes as input the representation in an existing (generative or
      discriminative) model, weakly supervised by limited side information. Applying
      a flexible and invertible transformation to the input leads to an interpretable
      representation with no loss in accuracy. We extend the approach using an active
      learning strategy to choose the most useful side information to obtain, allowing
      a human to guide what “interpretable" means. Our second framework relies on
      joint optimization for a representation which is both maximally informative
      about the side information and maximally compressive about the non-interpretable
      data factors. This leads to a novel perspective on the relationship between
      compression and regularization. We also propose a new interpretability evaluation
      metric based on our framework. Empirically, we achieve state-of-the-art results
      on three datasets using the two proposed algorithms.

    abstract: There is currently a great expansion of the impact of machine learning
      algorithms on our lives, prompting the need for objectives other than pure performance,
      including fairness. Fairness here means that the outcome of an automated decision-making
      system should not discriminate between subgroups characterized by sensitive
      attributes such as gender or race. Given any existing differentiable classifier,
      we make only slight adjustments to the architecture including adding a new hidden
      layer, in order to enable the concurrent adversarial optimization for fairness
      and accuracy. Our framework provides one way to quantify the tradeoff between
      fairness and accuracy, while also leading to strong empirical performance.

    abstract: One of the challenges to reinforcement learning (RL) is scalable transferability
      among complex tasks. Incorporating a graphical model (GM), along with the rich
      family of related methods, as a basis for RL frameworks provides potential to
      address issues such as transferability, generalisation and exploration. Here
      we propose a flexible GM-based RL framework which leverages efficient inference
      procedures to enhance generalisation and transfer power. In our proposed transferable
      and information-based graphical model framework ‘TibGM’, we show the equivalence
      between our mutual information-based objective in the GM, and an RL consolidated
      objective consisting of a standard reward maximisation target and a generalisation/transfer
      objective. In settings where there is a sparse or deceptive reward signal, our
      TibGM framework is flexible enough to incorporate exploration bonuses depicting
      intrinsic rewards. We empirically verify improved performance and exploration
      power.

    abstract: Computing the partition function Z of a discrete graphical model is
      a fundamental inference challenge. Since this is computationally intractable,
      variational approximations are often used in practice. Recently, so-called gauge
      transformations were used to improve variational lower bounds on Z. In this
      paper, we propose a new gauge-variational approach, termed WMBE-G, which combines
      gauge transformations with the weighted mini-bucket elimination (WMBE) method.
      WMBE-G can provide both upper and lower bounds on Z, and is easier to optimize
      than the prior gauge-variational algorithm. We show that WMBE-G strictly improves
      the earlier WMBE approximation for symmetric models including Ising models with
      no magnetic field. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
      WMBE-G even for generic, nonsymmetric models.

    abstract: Probabilistic graphical models are a key tool in machine learning applications.
      Computing the partition function, i.e., normalizing constant, is a fundamental
      task of statistical inference but it is generally computationally intractable,
      leading to extensive study of approximation methods. Iterative variational methods
      are a popular and successful family of approaches. However, even state of the
      art variational methods can return poor results or fail to converge on difficult
      instances. In this paper, we instead consider computing the partition function
      via sequential summation over variables. We develop robust approximate algorithms
      by combining ideas from mini-bucket elimination with tensor network and renormalization
      group methods from statistical physics. The resulting “convergence-free” methods
      show good empirical performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmark models,
      even for difficult instances.

    abstract: We define deep kernel processes in which positive definite Gram matrices
      are progressively transformed by nonlinear kernel functions and by sampling
      from (inverse) Wishart distributions. Remarkably, we find that deep Gaussian
      processes (DGPs), Bayesian neural networks (BNNs), infinite BNNs, and infinite
      BNNs with bottlenecks can all be written as deep kernel processes. For DGPs
      the equivalence arises because the Gram matrix formed by the inner product of
      features is Wishart distributed, and as we show, standard isotropic kernels
      can be written entirely in terms of this Gram matrix — we do not need knowledge
      of the underlying features. We define a tractable deep kernel process, the deep
      inverse Wishart process, and give a doubly-stochastic inducing-point variational
      inference scheme that operates on the Gram matrices, not on the features, as
      in DGPs. We show that the deep inverse Wishart process gives superior performance
      to DGPs and infinite BNNs on fully-connected baselines.

    abstract: 'Machine learning models based on the aggregated outputs of submodels,

      of such models: ensembles of neural networks and sparse mixture of experts (sparse
      MoEs). First, we show that the two approaches have complementary features whose
      combination is beneficial. This includes a comprehensive evaluation of sparse
      MoEs in uncertainty related benchmarks. Then, we present efficient ensemble
      of experts (E<sup>3</sup>), a scalable and simple ensemble of sparse MoEs that
      takes the best of both classes of models, while using up to 45% fewer FLOPs
      than a deep ensemble. Extensive experiments demonstrate the accuracy, log-likelihood,
      few-shot learning, robustness, and uncertainty improvements of E<sup>3</sup>
      over several challenging vision Transformer-based baselines. E<sup>3</sup> not
      only preserves its efficiency while scaling to models with up to 2.7B parameters,

    abstract: We present a novel compositional, generative model for vector space
      representations of meaning. This model reformulates earlier tensor-based approaches
      to vector space semantics as a top-down process, and provides efficient algorithms
      for transformation from natural language to vectors and from vectors to natural
      language. We describe procedures for estimating the parameters of the model
      from positive examples of similar phrases, and from distributional representations,
      then use these procedures to obtain similarity judgments for a set of adjective-noun
      pairs. The model’s estimation of the similarity of these pairs correlates well
      with human annotations, demonstrating a substantial improvement over several
      existing compositional approaches in both settings.

    abstract: The quantification of perfusion using dynamic susceptibility contrast
      MR imaging requires deconvolution to obtain the residual impulse-response function
      (IRF). Here, a method using a Gaussian process for deconvolution, GPD, is proposed.
      The fact that the IRF is smooth is incorporated as a constraint in the method.
      The GPD method, which automatically estimates the noise level in each voxel,
      has the advantage that model parameters are optimized automatically. The GPD
      is compared to singular value decomposition (SVD) using a common threshold for
      the singular values and to SVD using a threshold optimized according to the
      noise level in each voxel. The comparison is carried out using artificial data
      as well as using data from healthy volunteers. It is shown that GPD is comparable
      to SVD variable optimized threshold when determining the maximum of the IRF,
      which is directly related to the perfusion. GPD provides a better estimate of
      the entire IRF. As the signal to noise ratio increases or the time resolution
      of the measurements increases, GPD is shown to be superior to SVD. This is also
      found for large distribution volumes.

    abstract: Existing methods for estimating uncertainty in deep learning tend to
      require multiple forward passes, making them unsuitable for applications where
      computational resources are limited. To solve this, we perform probabilistic
      reasoning over the depth of neural networks. Different depths correspond to
      subnetworks which share weights and whose predictions are combined via marginalisation,
      yielding model uncertainty. By exploiting the sequential structure of feed-forward
      networks, we are able to both evaluate our training objective and make predictions
      with a single forward pass. We validate our approach on real-world regression
      and image classification tasks. Our approach provides uncertainty calibration,
      robustness to dataset shift, and accuracies competitive with more computationally
      expensive baselines.

    abstract: Both uncertainty estimation and interpretability are important factors
      for trustworthy machine learning systems. However, there is little work at the
      intersection of these two areas. We address this gap by proposing a novel method
      for interpreting uncertainty estimates from differentiable probabilistic models,
      like Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). Our method, Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty
      Explanations (CLUE), indicates how to change an input, while keeping it on the
      data manifold, such that a BNN becomes more confident about the input's prediction.
      We validate CLUE through 1) a novel framework for evaluating counterfactual
      explanations of uncertainty, 2) a series of ablation experiments, and 3) a user
      study. Our experiments show that CLUE outperforms baselines and enables practitioners
      to better understand which input patterns are responsible for predictive uncertainty..

    abstract: The linearised Laplace method for estimating model uncertainty has received
      renewed attention in the Bayesian deep learning community. The method provides
      reliable error bars and admits a closed-form expression for the model evidence,
      allowing for scalable selection of model hyperparameters. In this work, we examine
      the assumptions behind this method, particularly in conjunction with model selection.
      We show that these interact poorly with some now-standard tools of deep learning–stochastic
      approximation methods and normalisation layers–and make recommendations for
      how to better adapt this classic method to the modern setting. We provide theoretical
      support for our recommendations and validate them empirically on MLPs, classic
      CNNs, residual networks with and without normalisation layers, generative autoencoders
      and transformers.

    abstract: In hyperspectral image analysis the objective is to unmix a set of acquired
      pixels into pure spectral signatures (endmembers) and corresponding fractional
      abundances. The Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) methods have received
      a lot of attention for this unmixing process. Many of these NMF based unmixing
      algorithms are based on sparsity regularization encouraging pure spectral endmembers,
      but this is not optimal for certain applications, such as foods, where abundances
      are not sparse. The pixels will theoretically lie on a simplex and hence the
      endmembers can be estimated as the vertices of the smallest enclosing simplex.
      In this context we present a Bayesian framework employing a volume constraint
      for the NMF algorithm, where the posterior distribution is numerically sampled
      from using a Gibbs sampling procedure. We evaluate the method on synthetical
      and real hyperspectral data of wheat kernels.

    abstract: We propose a lower bound on the log marginal likelihood of Gaussian
      process regression models that can be computed without matrix factorisation
      of the full kernel matrix. We show that approximate maximum likelihood learning
      of model parameters by maximising our lower bound retains many benefits of the
      sparse variational approach while reducing the bias introduced into hyperparameter
      learning. The basis of our bound is a more careful analysis of the log-determinant
      term appearing in the log marginal likelihood, as well as using the method of
      conjugate gradients to derive tight lower bounds on the term involving a quadratic
      form. Our approach is a step forward in unifying methods relying on lower bound
      maximisation (e.g. variational methods) and iterative approaches based on conjugate
      gradients for training Gaussian processes. In experiments, we show improved
      predictive performance with our model for a comparable amount of training time
      compared to other conjugate gradient based approaches.

    abstract: The proliferation of computing devices has brought about an opportunity
      to deploy machine learning models on new problem domains using previously inaccessible
      data. Traditional algorithms for training such models often require data to
      be stored on a single machine with compute performed by a single node, making
      them unsuitable for decentralised training on multiple devices. This deficiency
      has motivated the development of federated learning algorithms, which allow
      multiple data owners to train collaboratively and use a shared model whilst
      keeping local data private. However, many of these algorithms focus on obtaining
      point estimates of model parameters, rather than probabilistic estimates capable
      of capturing model uncertainty, which is essential in many applications. Variational
      inference (VI) has become the method of choice for fitting many modern probabilistic
      models. In this paper we introduce partitioned variational inference (PVI),
      a general framework for performing VI in the federated setting. We develop new
      supporting theory for PVI, demonstrating a number of properties that make it
      an attractive choice for practitioners; use PVI to unify a wealth of fragmented,
      yet related literature; and provide empirical results that showcase the effectiveness
      of PVI in a variety of federated settings.

    abstract: Large, multi-dimensional spatio-temporal datasets are omnipresent in
      modern science and engineering. An effective framework for handling such data
      are Gaussian process deep generative models (GP-DGMs), which employ GP priors
      over the latent variables of DGMs. Existing approaches for performing inference
      in GP-DGMs do not support sparse GP approximations based on inducing points,
      which are essential for the computational efficiency of GPs, nor do they handle
      missing data – a natural occurrence in many spatio-temporal datasets – in a
      principled manner. We address these shortcomings with the development of the
      sparse Gaussian process variational autoencoder (SGP-VAE), characterised by
      the use of partial inference networks for parameterising sparse GP approximations.
      Leveraging the benefits of amortised variational inference, the SGP-VAE enables
      inference in multi-output sparse GPs on previously unobserved data with no additional
      training. The SGP-VAE is evaluated in a variety of experiments where it outperforms
      alternative approaches including multi-output GPs and structured VAEs.

    abstract: 'Gaussian processes are arguably the most important model class in spatial
      statistics. They encode prior information about the modeled function and can
      be used for exact or approximate Bayesian inference. In many applications, particularly
      in physical sciences and engineering, but also in areas such as geostatistics
      and neuroscience, invariance to symmetries is one of the most fundamental forms
      of prior information one can consider. The invariance of a Gaussian process''
      covariance to such symmetries gives rise to the most natural generalization
      of the concept of stationarity to such spaces. In this work, we develop constructive
      and practical techniques for building stationary Gaussian processes on a very
      large class of non-Euclidean spaces arising in the context of symmetries. Our
      techniques make it possible to (i) calculate covariance kernels and (ii) sample
      from prior and posterior Gaussian processes defined on such spaces, both in
      a practical manner. This work is split into two parts, each involving different
      technical considerations: part I studies compact spaces, while part II studies
      non-compact spaces possessing certain structure. Our contributions make the
      non-Euclidean Gaussian process models we study compatible with well-understood
      computational techniques available in standard Gaussian process software packages,
      thereby making them accessible to practitioners.'

    abstract: We consider the problem of multiclass classification where both labeled
      and unlabeled data points are given. We introduce and demonstrate a new approach
      for estimating a distribution over the missing labels where data points are
      viewed as nodes of a graph, and pairwise similarities are used to derive a transition
      probability matrix P for a Markov random walk between them. The algorithm associates
      each point with a particle which moves between points according to P. Labeled
      points are set to be absorbing states of the Markov random walk, and the probability
      of each particle to be absorbed by the different labeled points, as the number
      of steps increases, is then used to derive a distribution over the associated
      missing label. A computationally efficient algorithm to implement this is derived
      and demonstrated on both real and artificial data sets, including a numerical
      comparison with other methods.

    abstract: We consider the problem of clustering in its most basic form where only
      a local metric on the data space is given. No parametric statistical model is
      assumed, and the number of clusters is learned from the data. We introduce,
      analyze and demonstrate a novel approach to clustering where data points are
      viewed as nodes of a graph, and pairwise similarities are used to derive a transition
      probability matrix P for a Markov random walk between them. The algorithm automatically
      reveals structure at increasing scales by varying the number of steps taken
      by this random walk. Points are represented as rows of Pt, which are the t-step
      distributions of the walk starting at that point; these distributions are then
      clustered using a KL-minimizing iterative algorithm. Both the number of clusters,
      and the number of steps that best reveal it, are found by optimizing spectral
      properties of P.

    abstract: Spectral clustering is a simple yet powerful method for finding structure
      in data using spectral properties of an associated pairwise similarity matrix.
      This paper provides new insights into how the method works and uses these to
      derive new algorithms which given the data alone automatically learn different
      plausible data partitionings. The main theoretical contribution is a generalization
      of a key result in the field, the multicut lemma (Meila 2001). We use this generalization
      to derive two algorithms. The first uses the eigenvalues of a given affinity
      matrix to infer the number of clusters in data, and the second combines learning
      the affinity matrix with inferring the number of clusters. A hierarchical implementation
      of the algorithms is also derived. The algorithms are theoretically motivated
      and demonstrated on nontrivial data sets.

    abstract: Research on human-AI teams usually provides experts with a single label,
      which ignores the uncertainty in a model's recommendation. Conformal prediction
      (CP) is a well established line of research that focuses on building a theoretically
      grounded, calibrated prediction set, which may contain multiple labels. We explore
      how such prediction sets impact expert decision-making in human-AI teams. Our
      evaluation on human subjects finds that set valued predictions positively impact
      experts. However, we notice that the predictive sets provided by CP can be very
      large, which leads to unhelpful AI assistants. To mitigate this, we introduce
      D-CP, a method to perform CP on some examples and defer to experts. We prove
      that D-CP can reduce the prediction set size of non-deferred examples. We show
      how D-CP performs in quantitative and in human subject experiments (n=120).
      Our results suggest that CP prediction sets improve human-AI team performance
      over showing the top-1 prediction alone, and that experts find D-CP prediction
      sets are more useful than CP prediction sets.

    abstract: Although diverse news stories are actively posted on social media, readers
      often focus on news which reinforces their pre-existing views, leading to ‘filter
      bubble’ effects. To combat this, some recent systems expose and nudge readers
      toward stories with different points of view. One example is the Wall Street
      Journal’s ‘Blue Feed, Red Feed’ system, which presents posts from biased publishers
      on each side of a topic. However, these systems have had limited success. In
      this work, we present a complementary approach which identifies high consensus
      ‘purple’ posts that generate similar reactions from both ‘blue’ and ‘red’ readers.
      We define and operationalize consensus for news posts on Twitter in the context
      of US politics. We identify several high consensus posts and discuss their empirical
      properties. We present a highly scalable method for automatically identifying
      high and low consensus news posts on Twitter, by utilizing a novel category
      of audience leaning based features, which we show are well suited to this task.
      Finally, we build and publicly deploy our ‘Purple Feed’ system (twitter-app.mpi-sws.org/purple-feed),
      which highlights high consensus posts from publishers on both sides of the political
      spectrum.

    abstract: Beamforming is one of the most commonly used methods for estimating
      the active neural sources from the MEG or EEG sensor readings. The basic assumption
      in beamforming is that the sources are uncorrelated, which allows for estimating
      each source independent of the others. In this paper, we incorporate the independence
      assumption of the standard beamformer in a linear dynamical system, thereby
      introducing the dynamic beamformer. Using empirical data, we show that the dynamic
      beamformer outperforms the standard beamformer in predicting the condition of
      interest which strongly suggests that it also outperforms the standard method
      in localizing the active neural generators.

    abstract: 'On a mathematical level, most computational problems encountered in
      machine learning are instances of one of four abstract, fundamental problems:
      sampling, integration, optimization, and search. Thanks to the rich history
      of the respective mathematical fields, disparate methods with different properties
      have been developed for these four problem classes. As a result it can be beneficial
      to convert a problem from one abstract class into a problem of a different class,
      because the latter might come with insights, techniques, and algorithms well
      suited to the particular problem at hand. In particular, this thesis contributes
      four new methods and generalizations of existing methods for converting specific
      non-optimization machine learning tasks into optimization problems with more
      appealing properties. The first example is partition function estimation (an
      integration problem), where an existing algorithm – the Gumbel trick – for converting
      to the MAP optimization problem is generalized into a more general family of
      algorithms, such that other instances of this family have better statistical
      properties. Second, this family of algorithms is further generalized to another
      integration problem, the problem of estimating Rényi entropies. The third example
      shows how an intractable sampling problem arising when wishing to publicly release
      a database containing sensitive data in a safe ("differentially private") manner
      can be converted into an optimization problem using the theory of Reproducing
      Kernel Hilbert Spaces. Finally, the fourth case study casts the challenging
      discrete search problem of program synthesis from input-output examples as a
      supervised learning task that can be efficiently tackled using gradient-based
      optimization. In all four instances, the conversions result in novel algorithms
      with desirable properties. In the first instance, new generalizations of the
      Gumbel trick can be used to construct statistical estimators of the partition
      function that achieve the same estimation error while using up to 40'

    abstract: We develop a first line of attack for solving programming competition-style
      problems from input-output examples using deep learning. The approach is to
      train a neural network to predict properties of the program that generated the
      outputs from the inputs. We use the neural network's predictions to augment
      search techniques from the programming languages community, including enumerative
      search and an SMT-based solver. Empirically, we show that our approach leads
      to an order of magnitude speedup over the strong non-augmented baselines and
      a Recurrent Neural Network approach, and that we are able to solve problems
      of difficulty comparable to the simplest problems on programming competition

    abstract: Graph neural networks have become increasingly popular in recent years
      due to their ability to naturally encode relational input data and their ability
      to scale to large graphs by operating on a sparse representation of graph adjacency
      matrices. As we look to scale up these models using custom hardware, a natural
      assumption would be that we need hardware tailored to sparse operations and/or
      dynamic control flow. In this work, we question this assumption by scaling up
      sparse graph neural networks using a platform targeted at dense computation
      on fixed-size data. Drawing inspiration from optimization of numerical algorithms
      on sparse matrices, we develop techniques that enable training the sparse graph
      neural network model from Allamanis et al. [2018] in 13 minutes using a 512-core
      TPUv2 Pod, whereas the original training takes almost a day.

      on the first attempt, and perform iterative testing-based program fixing to
      get to the desired program functionality. Similarly, our approach first learns
      a distribution over programs conditioned on an encoding of a set of input-output
      examples, and then iteratively performs fix operations using the differentiable
      fixer. The fixer takes as input the original examples and the current program's
      outputs on example inputs, and generates a new distribution over the programs
      with the goal of reducing the discrepancies between the current program outputs
      and the desired example outputs. We train our architecture end-to-end on the
      RobustFill domain, and show that the addition of the fixer module leads to a
      significant improvement on synthesis accuracy compared to using beam search.

    abstract: We lay theoretical foundations for new database release mechanisms that
      allow third-parties to construct consistent estimators of population statistics,
      while ensuring that the privacy of each individual contributing to the database
      is protected. The proposed framework rests on two main ideas. First, releasing
      (an estimate of) the kernel mean embedding of the data generating random variable
      instead of the database itself still allows third-parties to construct consistent
      estimators of a wide class of population statistics. Second, the algorithm can
      satisfy the definition of differential privacy by basing the released kernel
      mean embedding on entirely synthetic data points, while controlling accuracy
      through the metric available in a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. We describe
      two instantiations of the proposed framework, suitable under different scenarios,
      and prove theoretical results guaranteeing differential privacy of the resulting
      algorithms and the consistency of estimators constructed from their outputs.

    abstract: The Gumbel trick is a method to sample from a discrete probability distribution,
      or to estimate its normalizing partition function. The method relies on repeatedly
      applying a random perturbation to the distribution in a particular way, each
      time solving for the most likely configuration. We derive an entire family of
      related methods, of which the Gumbel trick is one member, and show that the
      new methods have superior properties in several settings with minimal additional
      computational cost. In particular, for the Gumbel trick to yield computational
      benefits for discrete graphical models, Gumbel perturbations on all configurations
      are typically replaced with so-called low-rank perturbations. We show how a
      subfamily of our new methods adapts to this setting, proving new upper and lower
      bounds on the log partition function and deriving a family of sequential samplers
      for the Gibbs distribution. Finally, we balance the discussion by showing how
      the simpler analytical form of the Gumbel trick enables additional theoretical
      results.

    abstract: Good sparse approximations are essential for practical inference in
      Gaussian Processes as the computational cost of exact methods is prohibitive
      for large datasets. The Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) and the
      Variational Free Energy (VFE) approximations are two recent popular methods.
      Despite superficial similarities, these approximations have surprisingly different
      theoretical properties and behave differently in practice. We thoroughly investigate
      the two methods for regression both analytically and through illustrative examples,
      and draw conclusions to guide practical application.

    abstract: 'Motivation: We have used state-space models (SSMs) to reverse engineer
      transcriptional networks from highly replicated gene expression profiling time
      series data obtained from a well-established model of T cell activation. SSMs
      are a class of dynamic Bayesian networks in which the observed measurements
      depend on some hidden state variables that evolve according to Markovian dynamics.
      These hidden variables can capture effects that cannot be directly measured
      in a gene expression profiling experiment, for example: genes that have not
      been included in the microarray, levels of regulatory proteins, the effects
      of mRNA and protein degradation, etc. Results: We have approached the problem
      of inferring the model structure of these state-space models using both classical
      and Bayesian methods. In our previous work, a bootstrap procedure was used to
      derive classical confidence intervals for parameters representing `gene–gene''
      interactions over time. In this article, variational approximations are used
      to perform the analogous model selection task in the Bayesian context. Certain
      interactions are present in both the classical and the Bayesian analyses of
      these regulatory networks. The resulting models place JunB and JunD at the centre
      of the mechanisms that control apoptosis and proliferation. These mechanisms
      are key for clonal expansion and for controlling the long term behavior (e.g.
      programmed cell death) of these cells.'

    abstract: We show that it is possible to extend hidden Markov models to have a
      countably infinite number of hidden states. By using the theory of Dirichlet
      processes we can implicitly integrate out the infinitely many transition parameters,
      leaving only three hyperparameters which can be learned from data. These three
      hyperparameters define a hierarchical Dirichlet process capable of capturing
      a rich set of transition dynamics. The three hyperparameters control the time
      scale of the dynamics, the sparsity of the underlying state-transition matrix,
      and the expected number of distinct hidden states in a finite sequence. In this
      framework it is also natural to allow the alphabet of emitted symbols to be
      infinite — consider, for example, symbols being possible words appearing in
      English text.

    abstract: Computational models of visual cortex, and in particular those based
      on sparse coding, have enjoyed much recent attention. Despite this currency,
      the question of how sparse or how over-complete a sparse representation should
      be, has gone without principled answer. Here, we use Bayesian model-selection
      methods to address these questions for a sparse-coding model based on a Student-t
      prior. Having validated our methods on toy data, we find that natural images
      are indeed best modelled by extremely sparse distributions; although for the
      Student-t prior, the associated optimal basis size is only modestly over-complete.

    abstract: The visual system must learn to infer the presence of objects and features
      in the world from the images it encounters, and as such it must, either implicitly
      or explicitly, model the way these elements interact to create the image. Do
      the response properties of cells in the mammalian visual system reflect this
      constraint? To address this question, we constructed a probabilistic model in
      which the identity and attributes of simple visual elements were represented
      explicitly and learnt the parameters of this model from unparsed, natural video
      sequences. After learning, the behaviour and grouping of variables in the probabilistic
      model corresponded closely to functional and anatomical properties of simple
      and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). In particular, feature
      identity variables were activated in a way that resembled the activity of complex
      cells, while feature attribute variables responded much like simple cells. Furthermore,
      the grouping of the attributes within the model closely parallelled the reported
      anatomical grouping of simple cells in cat V1. Thus, this generative model makes
      explicit an interpretation of complex and simple cells as elements in the segmentation
      of a visual scene into basic independent features, along with a parametrisation
      of their moment-by-moment appearances. We speculate that such a segmentation
      may form the initial stage of a hierarchical system that progressively separates
      the identity and appearance of more articulated visual elements, culminating
      in view-invariant object recognition.

    abstract: Algorithmic transparency entails exposing system properties to various
      stakeholders for purposes that include understanding, improving, and contesting
      predictions. Until now, most research into algorithmic transparency has predominantly
      focused on explainability. Explainability attempts to provide reasons for a
      machine learning model's behavior to stakeholders. However, understanding a
      model's specific behavior alone might not be enough for stakeholders to gauge
      whether the model is wrong or lacks sufficient knowledge to solve the task at
      hand. In this paper, we argue for considering a complementary form of transparency
      by estimating and communicating the uncertainty associated with model predictions.
      First, we discuss methods for assessing uncertainty. Then, we characterize how
      uncertainty can be used to mitigate model unfairness, augment decision-making,
      and build trustworthy systems. Finally, we outline methods for displaying uncertainty
      to stakeholders and recommend how to collect information required for incorporating
      uncertainty into existing ML pipelines. This work constitutes an interdisciplinary
      review drawn from literature spanning machine learning, visualization/HCI, design,
      decision-making, and fairness. We aim to encourage researchers and practitioners
      to measure, communicate, and use uncertainty as a form of transparency.

    abstract: Explainable machine learning offers the potential to provide stakeholders
      with insights into model behavior by using various methods such as feature importance
      scores, counterfactual explanations, or influential training data. Yet there
      is little understanding of how organizations use these methods in practice.
      This study explores how organizations view and use explainability for stakeholder
      consumption. We find that, currently, the majority of deployments are not for
      end users affected by the model but rather for machine learning engineers, who
      use explainability to debug the model itself. There is thus a gap between explainability
      in practice and the goal of transparency, since explanations primarily serve
      internal stakeholders rather than external ones. Our study synthesizes the limitations
      of current explainability techniques that hamper their use for end users. To
      facilitate end user interaction, we develop a framework for establishing clear
      goals for explainability. We end by discussing concerns raised regarding explainability.

    abstract: In many complex robot applications, such as grasping and manipulation,
      it is difficult to program desired task solutions beforehand, as robots are
      within an uncertain and dynamic environment. In such cases, learning tasks from
      experience can be a useful alternative. To obtain a sound learning and generalization
      performance, machine learning, especially, reinforcement learning, usually requires
      sufficient data. However, in cases where only little data is available for learning,
      due to system constraints and practical issues, reinforcement learning can act
      suboptimally. In this paper, we investigate how model-based reinforcement learning,
      in particular the probabilistic inference for learning control method (PILCO),
      can be tailored to cope with the case of sparse data to speed up learning. The
      basic idea is to include further prior knowledge into the learning process.
      As PILCO is built on the probabilistic Gaussian processes framework, additional
      system knowledge can be incorporated by defining appropriate prior distributions,
      e.g. a linear mean Gaussian prior. The resulting PILCO formulation remains in
      closed form and analytically tractable. The proposed approach is evaluated in
      simulation as well as on a physical robot, the Festo Robotino XT. For the robot
      evaluation, we employ the approach for learning an object pick-up task. The
      results show that by including prior knowledge, policy learning can be sped
      up in presence of sparse data.

    abstract: We consider the problem of sampling a sequence from a discrete random
      prob- ability measure (RPM) with countable support, under (probabilistic) constraints
      of finite memory and computation. A canonical example is sampling from the Dirichlet
      Process, which can be accomplished using its well-known stick-breaking representation
      and lazy initialization of its atoms. We show that efficiently lazy initialization
      is possible if and only if a size-biased representation of the discrete RPM
      is known. For models constructed from such discrete RPMs, we consider the implications
      for generic particle-based inference methods in probabilistic program- ming
      systems. To demonstrate, we implement posterior inference for Normalized Inverse
      Gaussian Process mixture models in Turing.

    abstract: Methods of protein structure determination based on NMR chemical shifts
      are becoming increasingly common. The most widely used approaches adopt the
      molecular fragment replacement strategy, in which structural fragments are repeatedly
      reassembled into different complete conformations in molecular simulations.
      Although these approaches are effective in generating individual structures
      consistent with the chemical shift data, they do not enable the sampling of
      the conformational space of proteins with correct statistical weights. Here,
      we present a method of molecular fragment replacement that makes it possible
      to perform equilibrium simulations of proteins, and hence to determine their
      free energy landscapes. This strategy is based on the encoding of the chemical
      shift information in a probabilistic model in Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations.
      First, we demonstrate that with this approach it is possible to fold proteins
      to their native states starting from extended structures. Second, we show that
      the method satisfies the detailed balance condition and hence it can be used
      to carry out an equilibrium sampling from the Boltzmann distribution corresponding
      to the force field used in the simulations. Third, by comparing the results
      of simulations carried out with and without chemical shift restraints we describe
      quantitatively the effects that these restraints have on the free energy landscapes
      of proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the molecular fragment
      replacement strategy can be used in combination with chemical shift information
      to characterize not only the native structures of proteins but also their conformational
      fluctuations.

    abstract: In this paper, we present two classes of Bayesian approaches to the
      two-sample problem. Our first class of methods extends the Bayesian t-test to
      include all parametric models in the exponential family and their conjugate
      priors. Our second class of methods uses Dirichlet process mixtures (DPM) of
      such conjugate-exponential distributions as flexible nonparametric priors over
      the unknown distributions.

    abstract: 'Regression formulas are a domain-specific language adopted by several
      R packages for describing an important and useful class of statistical models:
      hierarchical linear regressions. Formulas are succinct, expressive, and clearly
      popular, so are they a useful addition to probabilistic programming languages?
      And what do they mean? We propose a core calculus of hierarchical linear regression,
      in which regression coefficients are themselves defined by nested regressions
      (unlike in R). We explain how our calculus captures the essence of the formula
      DSL found in R. We describe the design and implementation of Fabular, a version
      of the Tabular schema-driven probabilistic programming language, enriched with
      formulas based on our regression calculus. To the best of our knowledge, this
      is the first formal description of the core ideas of R''s formula notation,
      the first development of a calculus of regression formulas, and the first demonstration
      of the benefits of composing regression formulas and latent variables in a probabilistic

    abstract: Hidden Conditional Random Fields (HCRFs) are discriminative latent variable
      models which have been shown to successfully learn the hidden structure of a
      given classification problem. An infinite HCRF is an HCRF with a countably infinite
      number of hidden states, which rids us not only of the necessity to specify
      a priori a fixed number of hidden states available but also of the problem of
      overfitting. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithms are often employed
      for inference in such models. However, convergence of such algorithms is rather
      difficult to verify, and as the complexity of the task at hand increases, the
      computational cost of such algorithms often becomes prohibitive. These limitations
      can be overcome by variational techniques. In this paper, we present a generalized
      framework for infinite HCRF models, and a novel variational inference approach
      on a model based on coupled Dirichlet Process Mixtures, the HCRF–DPM. We show
      that the variational HCRF–DPM is able to converge to a correct number of represented
      hidden states, and performs as well as the best parametric HCRFs —chosen via
      cross–validation— for the difficult tasks of recognizing instances of agreement,
      disagreement, and pain in audiovisual sequences.

    abstract: The design of optimal adaptive controllers is usually based on heuristics,
      because solving Bellman's equations over information states is notoriously intractable.
      Approximate adaptive controllers often rely on the principle of certainty-equivalence
      where the control process deals with parameter point estimates as if they represented
      “true” parameter values. Here we present a stochastic control rule instead where
      controls are sampled from a posterior distribution over a set of probabilistic
      input-output models and the true model is identified by Bayesian inference.
      This allows reformulating the adaptive control problem as an inference and sampling
      problem derived from a minimum relative entropy principle. Importantly, inference
      and action sampling both work forward in time and hence such a Bayesian adaptive
      controller is applicable on-line. We demonstrate the improved performance that
      can be achieved by such an approach for linear quadratic regulator examples.

    abstract: Path integral methods have recently been shown to be applicable to a
      very general class of optimal control problems. Here we examine the path integral
      formalism from a decision-theoretic point of view, since an optimal controller
      can always be regarded as an instance of a perfectly rational decision-maker
      that chooses its actions so as to maximize its expected utility. The problem
      with perfect rationality is, however, that finding optimal actions is often
      very difficult due to prohibitive computational resource costs that are not
      taken into account. In contrast, a bounded rational decision-maker has only
      limited resources and therefore needs to strike some compromise between the
      desired utility and the required resource costs. In particular, we suggest an
      information-theoretic measure of resource costs that can be derived axiomatically.
      As a consequence we obtain a variational principle for choice probabilities
      that trades off maximizing a given utility criterion and avoiding resource costs
      that arise due to deviating from initially given default choice probabilities.
      The resulting bounded rational policies are in general probabilistic. We show
      that the solutions found by the path integral formalism are such bounded rational
      policies. Furthermore, we show that the same formalism generalizes to discrete
      control problems, leading to linearly solvable bounded rational control policies
      in the case of Markov systems. Importantly, Bellman's optimality principle is
      not presupposed by this variational principle, but it can be derived as a limit
      case. This suggests that the information theoretic formalization of bounded
      rationality might serve as a general principle in control design that unifies
      a number of recently reported approximate optimal control methods both in the
      continuous and discrete domain.

    abstract: 'Trying to pass someone walking toward you in a narrow corridor is a
      familiar example of a two-person motor game that requires coordination. In this
      study, we investigate coordination in sensorimotor tasks that correspond to
      classic coordination games with multiple Nash equilibria, such as "choosing
      sides", "stag hunt", "chicken", and "battle of sexes". In these tasks, subjects
      made reaching movements reflecting their continuously evolving "decisions" while
      they received a continuous payoff in the form of a resistive force counteracting
      their movements. Successful coordination required two subjects to "choose" the
      same Nash equilibrium in this force-payoff landscape within a single reach.
      We found that on the majority of trials coordination was achieved. Compared
      to the proportion of trials in which miscoordination occurred, successful coordination
      was characterized by several distinct features: an increased mutual information
      between the players'' movement endpoints, an increased joint entropy during
      the movements, and by differences in the timing of the players'' responses.
      Moreover, we found that the probability of successful coordination depends on
      the players'' initial distance from the Nash equilibria. Our results suggest
      that two-person coordination arises naturally in motor interactions and is facilitated
      by favorable initial positions, stereotypical motor pattern, and differences
      in response times.'

    abstract: Social interactions in classic cognitive games likeBlack-box alpha (BB-α)
      is a new approximate inference method based on the minimization of α-divergences.
      BB-αscales to large datasets because it can be implemented using stochastic
      gradient descent. BB-αcan be applied to complex probabilistic models with little
      effort since it only requires as input the likelihood function and its gradients.
      These gradients can be easily obtained using automatic differentiation. By changing
      the divergence parameter α, the method is able to interpolate between variational
      Bayes (VB) (α→0) and an algorithm similar to expectation propagation (EP) (α=
      1). Experiments on probit regression and neural network regression and classification
      problems show that BB-αwith non-standard settings of α, such as α= 0.5, usually
      produces better predictions than with α→0 (VB) or α= 1 (EP). the ultimatum game
      or the prisoner's dilemma typically lead to Nash equilibria when multiple competitive
      decision makers with perfect knowledge select optimal strategies. However, in
      evolutionary game theory it has been shown that Nash equilibria can also arise
      as attractors in dynamical systems that can describe, for example, the population
      dynamics of microorganisms. Similar to such evolutionary dynamics, we find that
      Nash equilibria arise naturally in motor interactions in which players vie for
      control and try to minimize effort. When confronted with sensorimotor interaction
      tasks that correspond to the classical prisoner's dilemma and the rope-pulling
      game, two-player motor interactions led predominantly to Nash solutions. In
      contrast, when a single player took both roles, playing the sensorimotor game
      bimanually, cooperative solutions were found. Our methodology opens up a new
      avenue for the study of human motor interactions within a game theoretic framework,
      suggesting that the coupling of motor systems can lead to game theoretic solutions.

    abstract: We introduce a conceptually novel structured prediction model, GPstruct,
      which is kernelized, non-parametric and Bayesian, by design. We motivate the
      model with respect to existing approaches, among others, conditional random
      fields (CRFs), maximum margin Markov networks (M3N), and structured support
      vector machines (SVMstruct), which embody only a subset of its properties. We
      present an inference procedure based on Markov Chain Monte Carlo. The framework
      can be instantiated for a wide range of structured objects such as linear chains,
      trees, grids, and other general graphs. As a proof of concept, the model is
      benchmarked on several natural language processing tasks and a video gesture
      segmentation task involving a linear chain structure. We show prediction accuracies
      for GPstruct which are comparable to or exceeding those of CRFs and SVMstruct.

    abstract: Structured prediction is an important and well studied problem with
      many applications across machine learning. GPstruct is a recently proposed structured
      prediction model that offers appealing properties such as being kernelised,
      non-parametric, and supporting Bayesian inference (Bratières et al. 2013). The
      model places a Gaussian process prior over energy functions which describe relationships
      between input variables and structured output variables. However, the memory
      demand of GPstruct is quadratic in the number of latent variables and training
      runtime scales cubically. This prevents GPstruct from being applied to problems
      involving grid factor graphs, which are prevalent in computer vision and spatial
      statistics applications. Here we explore a scalable approach to learning GPstruct
      models based on ensemble learning, with weak learners (predictors) trained on
      subsets of the latent variables and bootstrap data, which can easily be distributed.
      We show experiments with 4M latent variables on image segmentation. Our method
      outperforms widely-used conditional random field models trained with pseudo-likelihood.
      Moreover, in image segmentation problems it improves over recent state-of-the-art
      marginal optimisation methods in terms of predictive performance and uncertainty
      calibration. Finally, it generalises well on all training set sizes.

    abstract: In order to make predictions with high accuracy, conventional deep learning
      systems require large training datasets consisting of thousands or millions
      of examples and long training times measured in hours or days, consuming high
      levels of electricity with a negative impact on our environment. It is desirable
      to have have machine learning systems that can emulate human behavior such that
      they can quickly learn new concepts from only a few examples. This is especially
      true if we need to quickly customize or personalize machine learning models
      to specific scenarios where it would be impractical to acquire a large amount
      of training data and where a mobile device is the means for computation. We
      define a data efficient machine learning system to be one that can learn a new
      concept from only a few examples (or shots) and a computation efficient machine
      learning system to be one that can learn a new concept rapidly without retraining
      on an everyday computing device such as a smart phone. In this work, we design,
      develop, analyze, and extend the theory of machine learning systems that are
      both data efficient and computation efficient. We present systems that are trained
      using multiple tasks such that it "learns how to learn" to solve new tasks from
      only a few examples. These systems can efficiently solve new, unseen tasks drawn
      from a broad range of data distributions, in both the low and high data regimes,
      without the need for costly retraining. Adapting to a new task requires only
      a forward pass of the example task data through the trained network making the
      learning of new tasks possible on mobile devices. In particular, we focus on
      few-shot image classification systems, i.e. machine learning systems that can
      distinguish between numerous classes of objects depicted in digital images given
      only a few examples of each class of object to learn from.

    abstract: Modern meta-learning approaches for image classification rely on increasingly
      deep networks to achieve state-of-the-art performance, making batch normalization
      an essential component of meta-learning pipelines. However, the hierarchical
      nature of the meta-learning setting presents several challenges that can render
      conventional batch normalization ineffective, giving rise to the need to rethink
      normalization in this setting. We evaluate a range of approaches to batch normalization
      for meta-learning scenarios, and develop a novel approach that we call TASKNORM.
      Experiments on fourteen datasets demonstrate that the choice of batch normalization
      has a dramatic effect on both classification accuracy and training time for
      both gradient based and gradient free meta-learning approaches. Importantly,
      TASKNORM is found to consistently improve performance. Finally, we provide a
      set of best practices for normalization that will allow fair comparison of meta-learning
      algorithms.

    abstract: Meta learning approaches to few-shot classification are computationally
      efficient at test time, requiring just a few optimization steps or single forward
      pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to train.
      This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can contain
      up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be taken.
      Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires either
      parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be available,
      or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints apply. We
      improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory efficient episodic
      training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks composed of large
      images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the gradients for
      a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's training images.
      This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire training set but
      realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a random subset
      of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the full gradient.
      We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracy
      on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4 parts of the challenging VTAB+
      MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners. LITE also enables meta-learners
      to be competitive with transfer learning approaches but at a fraction of the
      test-time computational cost, thus serving as a counterpoint to the recent narrative
      that transfer learning is all you need for few-shot classification.

    abstract: Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs) leverage the flexibility and
      interpretability of GPs while capturing structure across outputs, which is desirable,
      for example, in spatio-temporal modelling. The key problem with MOGPs is their
      computational scaling O(n^3 p^3), which is cubic in the number of both inputs
      n (e.g., time points or locations) and outputs p. For this reason, a popular
      class of MOGPs assumes that the data live around a low-dimensional linear subspace,
      reducing the complexity to O(n^3 m^3). However, this cost is still cubic in
      the dimensionality of the subspace m, which is still prohibitively expensive
      for many applications. We propose the use of a sufficient statistic of the data
      to accelerate inference and learning in MOGPs with orthogonal bases. The method
      achieves linear scaling in m in practice, allowing these models to scale to
      large m without sacrificing significant expressivity or requiring approximation.
      This advance opens up a wide range of real-world tasks and can be combined with
      existing GP approximations in a plug-and-play way. We demonstrate the efficacy
      of the method on various synthetic and real-world data sets.

    abstract: 'The Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM; Tobar et al., 2015a)
      is a model for signals with complex spectral structure. A significant limitation
      of the GPCM is that it assumes a rapidly decaying spectrum: it can only model
      smooth signals. Moreover, inference in the GPCM currently requires (1) a mean-field
      assumption, resulting in poorly calibrated uncertainties, and (2) a tedious
      variational optimisation of large covariance matrices. We redesign the GPCM
      model to induce a richer distribution over the spectrum with relaxed assumptions
      about smoothness: the Causal Gaussian Process Convolution Model (CGPCM) introduces
      a causality assumption into the GPCM, and the Rough Gaussian Process Convolution
      Model (RGPCM) can be interpreted as a Bayesian nonparametric generalisation
      of the fractional Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process. We also propose a more effective
      variational inference scheme, going beyond the mean-field assumption: we design
      a Gibbs sampler which directly samples from the optimal variational solution,
      circumventing any variational optimisation entirely. The proposed variations
      of the GPCM are validated in experiments on synthetic and real-world data, showing
      promising results.'

    abstract: Deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) are multi-layer hierarchical generalisations
      of Gaussian processes (GPs) and are formally equivalent to neural networks with
      multiple, infinitely wide hidden layers. DGPs are nonparametric probabilistic
      models and as such are arguably more flexible, have a greater capacity to generalise,
      and provide better calibrated uncertainty estimates than alternative deep models.
      This paper develops a new approximate Bayesian learning scheme that enables
      DGPs to be applied to a range of medium to large scale regression problems for
      the first time. The new method uses an approximate Expectation Propagation procedure
      and a novel and efficient extension of the probabilistic backpropagation algorithm
      for learning. We evaluate the new method for non-linear regression on eleven
      real-world datasets, showing that it always outperforms GP regression and is
      almost always better than state-of-the-art deterministic and sampling-based
      approximate inference methods for Bayesian neural networks. As a by-product,
      this work provides a comprehensive analysis of six approximate Bayesian methods
      for training neural networks.

    abstract: Sparse approximations for Gaussian process models provide a suite of
      methods that enable these models to be deployed in large data regime and enable
      analytic intractabilities to be sidestepped. However, the field lacks a principled
      method to handle streaming data in which the posterior distribution over function
      values and the hyperparameters are updated in an online fashion. The small number
      of existing approaches either use suboptimal hand-crafted heuristics for hyperparameter
      learning, or suffer from catastrophic forgetting or slow updating when new data
      arrive. This paper develops a new principled framework for deploying Gaussian
      process probabilistic models in the streaming setting, providing principled
      methods for learning hyperparameters and optimising pseudo-input locations.
      The proposed framework is experimentally validated using synthetic and real-world
      datasets.

    abstract: Gaussian process regression can be accelerated by constructing a small
      pseudo-dataset to summarize the observed data. This idea sits at the heart of
      many approximation schemes, but such an approach requires the number of pseudo-datapoints
      to be scaled with the range of the input space if the accuracy of the approximation
      is to be maintained. This presents problems in time-series settings or in spatial
      datasets where large numbers of pseudo-datapoints are required since computation
      typically scales quadratically with the pseudo-dataset size. In this paper we
      devise an approximation whose complexity grows linearly with the number of pseudo-datapoints.
      This is achieved by imposing a tree or chain structure on the pseudo-datapoints
      and calibrating the approximation using a Kullback-Leibler (KL) minimization.
      Inference and learning can then be performed efficiently using the Gaussian
      belief propagation algorithm. We demonstrate the validity of our approach on
      a set of challenging regression tasks including missing data imputation for
      audio and spatial datasets. We trace out the speed-accuracy trade-off for the
      new method and show that the frontier dominates those obtained from a large
      number of existing approximation techniques.

    abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are flexible distributions over functions that
      enable high-level assumptions about unknown functions to be encoded in a parsimonious,
      flexible and general way. Although elegant, the application of GPs is limited
      by computational and analytical intractabilities that arise when data are sufficiently
      numerous or when employing non-Gaussian models. Consequently, a wealth of GP
      approximation schemes have been developed over the last 15 years to address
      these key limitations. Many of these schemes employ a small set of pseudo data
      points to summarise the actual data. In this paper we develop a new pseudo-point
      approximation framework using Power Expectation Propagation (Power EP) that
      unifies a large number of these pseudo-point approximations. Unlike much of
      the previous venerable work in this area, the new framework is built on standard
      methods for approximate inference (variational free-energy, EP and Power EP
      methods) rather than employing approximations to the probabilistic generative
      model itself. In this way all of the approximation is performed at `inference
      time' rather than at `modelling time', resolving awkward philosophical and empirical
      questions that trouble previous approaches. Crucially, we demonstrate that the
      new framework includes new pseudo-point approximation methods that outperform
      current approaches on regression and classification tasks.

    abstract: 'Models with Gaussian process priors and Gaussian likelihoods are one
      of only a handful of Bayesian models where inference can be performed without
      the need for approximation. However, a frequent criticism of these models from
      practitioners of Bayesian machine learning is that they are challenging to scale
      to large datasets due to the need to compute a large kernel matrix and perform
      standard linear-algebraic operations with this matrix. This limitation has driven
      decades of research in both statistics and machine learning seeking to scale
      Gaussian process regression models to ever-larger datasets. This thesis builds
      on this line of research. We focus on the problem of approximate inference and
      model selection with approximate maximum marginal likelihood as applied to Gaussian
      process regression. Our discussion is guided by three questions: Does an approximation
      work on a range of models and datasets? Can you verify that an approximation
      has worked on a given dataset? Is an approximation easy for a practitioner to
      use? While we are far from the first to ask these questions, we offer new insights
      into each question in the context of Gaussian process regression. In the first
      part of this thesis, we focus on sparse variational Gaussian process regression
      (Titsias, 2009). We provide new diagnostics for inference with this method that
      can be used as practical guides for practitioners trying to balance computation
      and accuracy with this approximation. We then provide an asymptotic analysis
      that highlights properties of the model and dataset that are sufficient for
      this approximation to perform reliable inference with a small computational
      cost. This analysis builds on an approach laid out in Burt (2018), as well as
      on similar guarantees in the kernel ridge regression literature. In the second
      part of this thesis, we consider iterative methods, especially the method of
      conjugate gradients, as applied to Gaussian process regression (Gibbs and MacKay,
      1997). We primarily focus on improving the reliability of approximate maximum
      marginal likelihood when using these approximations. We investigate how the
      method of conjugate gradients and related approaches can be used to derive bounds
      on quantities related to the log marginal likelihood. This idea can be used
      to improve the speed and stability of model selection with these approaches,
      making them easier to use in practice.'

    abstract: Recent work has attempted to directly approximate the ‘function-space’
      or predictive posterior distribution of Bayesian models, without approximating
      the posterior distribution over the parameters. This is appealing in e.g. Bayesian
      neural networks, where we only need the former, and the latter is hard to represent.
      In this work, we highlight some advantages and limitations of employing the
      Kullback-Leibler divergence in this setting. For example, we show that minimizing
      the KL divergence between a wide class of parametric distributions and the posterior
      induced by a (non-degenerate) Gaussian process prior leads to an ill-defined
      objective function. Then, we propose (featurized) Bayesian linear regression
      as a benchmark for ‘function-space’ inference methods that directly measures
      approximation quality. We apply this methodology to assess aspects of the objective
      function and inference scheme considered in Sun et al. (2018), emphasizing the
      quality of approximation to Bayesian inference as opposed to predictive performance.

    abstract: Excellent variational approximations to Gaussian process posteriors
      have been developed which avoid the O(N<sup>3</sup>) scaling with dataset size
      N. They reduce the computational cost to O(NM<sup>2</sup>), with M   Lt;N being
      the number of inducing variables, which summarise the process. While the computational
      cost seems to be linear in N, the true complexity of the algorithm depends on
      how M must increase to ensure a certain quality of approximation. We address
      this by characterising the behavior of an upper bound on the KL divergence to
      the posterior. We show that with high probability the KL divergence can be made
      arbitrarily small by growing M more slowly than N. A particular case of interest
      is that for regression with normally distributed inputs in D-dimensions with
      the popular Squared Exponential kernel, M=O(log<sup>D</sup>N) is sufficient.
      Our results show that as datasets grow, Gaussian process posteriors can truly
      be approximated cheaply, and provide a concrete rule for how to increase M in
      continual learning scenarios.

    abstract: Gaussian processes are distributions over functions that are versatile
      and mathematically convenient priors in Bayesian modelling. However, their use
      is often impeded for data with large numbers of observations, N, due to the
      cubic (in N) cost of matrix operations used in exact inference. Many solutions
      have been proposed that rely on M << N inducing variables to form an approximation
      at a cost of O(NM<sup>2</sup>). While the computational cost appears linear
      in N, the true complexity depends on how M must scale with N to ensure a certain
      quality of the approximation. In this work, we investigate upper and lower bounds
      on how M needs to grow with N to ensure high quality approximations. We show
      that we can make the KL-divergence between the approximate model and the exact
      posterior arbitrarily small for a Gaussian-noise regression model with M <<
      N. Specifically, for the popular squared exponential kernel and D-dimensional
      Gaussian distributed covariates, M = O((log N)<sup>D</sup>) suffice and a method
      with an overall computational cost of O(N(log N)<sup>2D</sup>(log log N)<sup>2</sup>)
      can be used to perform inference.

    abstract: Racial disparities in US drug arrest rates have been observed for decades,
      but their causes and policy implications are still contested. Some have argued
      that the disparities largely reflect differences in drug use between racial
      groups, while others have hypothesized that discriminatory enforcement policies
      and police practices play a significant role. In this work, we analyze racial
      disparities in the enforcement of marijuana violations in the US. Using data
      from the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) and the National Survey
      on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) programs, we investigate whether marijuana usage
      and purchasing behaviors can explain the racial composition of offenders in
      police records. We examine potential driving mechanisms behind these disparities
      and the extent to which county-level socioeconomic factors are associated with
      corresponding disparities. Our results indicate that the significant racial
      disparities in reported incidents and arrests cannot be explained by differences
      in marijuana days-of-use alone. Variations in the location where marijuana is
      purchased and in the frequency of these purchases partially explain the observed
      disparities. We observe an increase in racial disparities across most counties
      over the last decade, with the greatest increases in states that legalized the
      use of marijuana within this timeframe. Income, high school graduation rate,
      and rate of employment positively correlate with larger racial disparities,
      while the rate of incarceration is negatively correlated. We conclude with a
      discussion of the implications of the observed racial disparities in the context
      of algorithmic fairness.

    abstract: There is a widespread intuition that model-based control methods should
      be able to surpass the data efficiency of model-free approaches. In this paper
      we attempt to evaluate this intuition on various challenging locomotion tasks.
      We take a hybrid approach, combining model predictive control (MPC) with a learned
      model and model-free policy learning; the learned policy serves as a proposal
      for MPC. We show that MPC with learned proposals and models (trained on the
      fly or transferred from related tasks) can significantly improve performance
      and data efficiency with respect to model-free methods. However, we find that
      well-tuned model-free agents are strong baselines even for high DoF control
      problems. Finally, we show that it is possible to distil a model-based planner
      into a policy that amortizes the planning computation without any loss of performance.

    abstract: Lipschitz quadrature methods provide an approach to one-dimensional
      numerical integration on bounded domains. On the basis of the assumption that
      the integrand is Lipschitz continuous with a known Lipschitz constant, these
      quadrature rules can provide a tight error bound around their integral estimates
      and utilise the Lipschitz constant to guide exploration in the context of adaptive
      quadrature. In this paper, we outline our ongoing work on extending this approach
      to settings where the Lipschitz constant is probabilistically uncertain. As
      the key component, we introduce a Bayesian approach for updating a subjectively
      probabilistic belief of the Lipschitz constant. Combined with any Lipschitz
      quadrature rule, we obtain an approach for translating a sample into an integral
      estimate with probabilistic uncertainty intervals. The paper concludes with
      an illustration of the approach followed by a discussion of open issues and
      future work.

    abstract: Techniques known as Nonlinear Set Membership prediction, Lipschitz Interpolation
      or Kinky Inference are approaches to machine learning that utilise presupposed
      Lipschitz properties to compute inferences over unobserved function values.
      Provided a bound on the true best Lipschitz constant of the target function
      is known a priori they offer convergence guarantees as well as bounds around
      the predictions. Considering a more general setting that builds on Hölder continuity
      relative to pseudo-metrics, we propose an online method for estimating the Hoelder
      constant online from function value observations that possibly are corrupted
      by bounded observational errors. Utilising this to compute adaptive parameters
      within a kinky inference rule gives rise to a nonparametric machine learning
      method, for which we establish strong universal approximation guarantees. That
      is, we show that our prediction rule can learn any continuous function in the
      limit of increasingly dense data to within a worst-case error bound that depends
      on the level of observational uncertainty. We apply our method in the context
      of nonparametric model-reference adaptive control (MRAC). Across a range of
      simulated aircraft roll-dynamics and performance metrics our approach outperforms
      recently proposed alternatives that were based on Gaussian processes and RBF-neural
      networks. For discrete-time systems, we provide stability guarantees for our
      learning-based controllers both for the batch and the online learning setting.

    abstract: Techniques known as Nonlinear Set Membership prediction, Kinky Inference
      or Lipschitz Interpolation are fast and numerically robust approaches to nonparametric
      machine learning that have been proposed to be utilised in the context of system
      identification and learning-based control. They utilise presupposed Lipschitz
      properties in order to compute inferences over unobserved function values. Unfortunately,
      most of these approaches rely on exact knowledge about the input space metric
      as well as about the Lipschitz constant. Furthermore, existing techniques to
      estimate the Lipschitz constants from the data are not robust to noise or seem
      to be ad-hoc and typically are decoupled from the ultimate learning and prediction
      task. To overcome these limitations, we propose an approach for optimising parameters
      of the presupposed metrics by minimising validation set prediction errors. To
      avoid poor performance due to local minima, we propose to utilise Lipschitz
      properties of the optimisation objective to ensure global optimisation success.
      The resulting approach is a new flexible method for nonparametric black-box
      learning. We illustrate its competitiveness on a set of benchmark problems.

    abstract: We develop an indirect mechanism for coordinated, distributed multi-agent
      optimisation, and decision-making. Our approach extends previous work in no-regret
      learning based mechanism design and renders it applicable to partial information
      settings. We consider planning problems that can be stated as a collection of
      single-agent convex programmes coupled by common soft constraints. A key idea
      is to recast the joint optimisation problem as distributed learning in a repeated
      game between the original agents and a newly introduced group of adversarial
      agents who influence prices for decisions and facilitate coordination. Under
      the weak behavioural assumption that all agents employ selfish, sub-linear regret
      algorithms in the course of the repeated game, we guarantee that our mechanism
      can achieve design goals such as social optimality (efficiency) and Nash-equilibrium
      convergence to within an error which approaches zero as the agents gain experience.
      Our error bounds are deterministic or probabilistic, depending on the nature
      of the regret bounds available for the algorithms employed by the agents. We
      illustrate our method in an emissions market application.

    abstract: Off-the-shelf Gaussian Process (GP) covariance functions encode smoothness
      assumptions on the structure of the function to be modeled. To model complex
      and nondifferentiable functions, these smoothness assumptions are often too
      restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different representation
      of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space is often learned
      in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data representations that are not
      useful for the overall regression task. In this paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian
      Processes, a novel supervised method that jointly learns a transformation of
      the data into a feature space and a GP regression from the feature space to
      observed space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to learn data representations,
      which are useful for the overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we
      evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform
      poorly, such as step functions and robotics tasks with contacts.

    abstract: Methods known as Lipschitz Interpolation or Nonlinear Set Membership
      regression have become established tools for nonparametric system-identification
      and data-based control. They utilise presupposed Lipschitz properties to compute
      inferences over unobserved function values. Unfortunately, they rely on the
      a priori knowledge of a Lipschitz constant of the underlying target function
      which serves as a hyperparameter. We propose a closed-form estimator of the
      Lipschitz constant that is robust to bounded observational noise in the data.
      The merger of Lipschitz Interpolation with the new hyperparameter estimator
      gives a new nonparametric machine learning method for which we derive online
      learning convergence guarantees. Furthermore, we apply our learning method to
      model-reference adaptive control and provide a convergence guarantee on the
      closed-loop dynamics. In a simulated flight manoeuvre control scenario, we compare
      the performance of our approach to recently proposed alternative learning-based
      controllers.

      ethics, understood as research aiming to build “ethical machines.” We clarify
      the nature of this goal, why it is worth pursuing, and the risks involved in
      its pursuit. First, we survey and clarify some of the philosophical issues surrounding
      the concept of an “ethical machine” and the aims of machine ethics. Second,
      we argue that while there are good prima facie reasons for pursuing machine
      ethics, including the potential to improve the ethical alignment of both humans
      and machines, there are also potential risks that must be considered. Third,
      we survey these potential risks and point to where research should be devoted
      to clarifying and managing potential risks. We conclude by making some recommendations
      about the questions that future work could address.

    abstract: It has previously been shown that low-frequency fluctuations in both
      respiratory volume and cardiac rate can induce changes in the blood-oxygen level
      dependent (BOLD) signal. Such physiological noise can obscure the detection
      of neural activation using fMRI, and it is therefore important to model and
      remove the effects of this noise. While a hemodynamic response function relating
      respiratory variation (RV) and the BOLD signal has been described, no such mapping
      for heart rate (HR) has been proposed. In the current study, the effects of
      RV and HR are simultaneously deconvolved from resting state fMRI. It is demonstrated
      that a convolution model including RV and HR can explain significantly more
      variance in gray matter BOLD signal than a model that includes RV alone, and
      an average HR response function is proposed that well characterizes our subject
      population. It is observed that the voxel-wise morphology of the deconvolved
      RV responses is preserved when HR is included in the model, and that its form
      is adequately modeled by Birn et al.'s previously described respiration response
      function. Furthermore, it is shown that modeling out RV and HR can significantly
      alter functional connectivity maps of the default-mode network.

    abstract: We describe variational inference approaches in Gaussian process state
      space models in terms of local linearisations of the approximate posterior function.
      Most previous approaches have either assumed independence between the posterior
      dynamics and latent states (the mean-field (MF) approximation), or optimised
      free parameters for both, leading to limited scalability. We use our framework
      to prove that (i) there is a theoretical imperative to use non-MF approaches,
      to avoid excessive bias in the process noise hyperparameter estimate, and (ii)
      we can parameterise only the posterior dynamics without any less of performance.
      Our approach suggests further approximations, based on the existing rich literature
      on filtering and smoothing for nonlinear systems, and unifies approaches for
      discrete and continuous time models.

    abstract: It is well understood that client-master communication can be a primary
      bottleneck in federated learning (FL). In this work, we address this issue with
      a novel client subsampling scheme, where we restrict the number of clients allowed
      to communicate their updates back to the master node. In each communication
      round, all participating clients compute their updates, but only the ones with
      important updates communicate back to the master. We show that importance can
      be measured using only the norm of the update and give a formula for optimal
      client participation. This formula minimizes the distance between the full update,
      where all clients participate, and our limited update, where the number of participating
      clients is restricted. In addition, we provide a simple algorithm that approximates
      the optimal formula for client participation, which allows for secure aggregation
      and stateless clients, and thus does not compromise client privacy. We show
      both theoretically and empirically that for Distributed SGD (DSGD) and Federated
      Averaging (FedAvg), the performance of our approach can be close to full participation
      and superior to the baseline where participating clients are sampled uniformly.
      Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to and compatible with existing methods
      for reducing communication overhead, such as local methods and communication
      compression methods.

    abstract: In recent years, there has been considerable interest in embedding continuous
      time methods in machine learning algorithms. In system identification, the task
      is to learn a dynamical model from incomplete observation data, and when prior
      knowledge is in continuous time – for example, mechanistic differential equation
      models – it seems natural to use continuous time models for learning. Yet when
      learning flexible, nonlinear, probabilistic dynamics models, most previous work
      has focused on discrete time models to avoid computational, numerical, and mathematical
      difficulties. In this work we show, with the aid of small-scale examples, that
      this mismatch between model and data generating process can be consequential
      under certain circumstances, and we discuss possible modifications to discrete
      time models which may better suit them to handling data generated by continuous
      time processes.

    abstract: We propose Adaptive Deep Kernel Fitting with Implicit Function Theorem
      (ADKF-IFT), a novel framework for learning deep kernel Gaussian processes (GPs)
      by interpolating between meta-learning and conventional deep kernel learning.
      Our approach employs a bilevel optimization objective where we meta-learn generally
      useful feature representations across tasks, in the sense that task-specific
      GP models estimated on top of such features achieve the lowest possible predictive
      loss on average. We solve the resulting nested optimization problem using the
      implicit function theorem (IFT). We show that our ADKF-IFT framework contains
      previously proposed Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT)
      as special cases. Although ADKF-IFT is a completely general method, we argue
      that it is especially well-suited for drug discovery problems and demonstrate
      that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on a variety
      of real-world few-shot molecular property prediction tasks and out-of-domain
      molecular property prediction and optimization tasks.

      regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but
      using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without
      relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax
      attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal
      Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for
      scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can also be used to efficiently model kernelizable

      to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale

      Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers
      and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation
      of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We

    abstract: We present an in-depth examination of the effectiveness of radial basis
      function kernel (beyond Gaussian) estimators based on orthogonal random feature
      maps. We show that orthogonal estimators outperform state-of-the-art mechanisms
      that use iid sampling under weak conditions for tails of the associated Fourier
      distributions. We prove that for the case of many dimensions, the superiority
      of the orthogonal transform can be accurately measured by a property we define
      called the charm of the kernel, and that orthogonal random features provide
      optimal (in terms of mean squared error) kernel estimators. We provide the first
      theoretical results which explain why orthogonal random features outperform
      unstructured on downstream tasks such as kernel ridge regression by showing

    abstract: We present a new method of blackbox optimization via gradient approximation
      with the use of structured random orthogonal matrices, providing more accurate
      estimators than baselines and with provable theoretical guarantees. We show
      that this algorithm can be successfully applied to learn better quality compact
      policies than those using standard gradient estimation techniques. The compact
      policies we learn have several advantages over unstructured ones, including
      faster training algorithms and faster inference. These benefits are important
      when the policy is deployed on real hardware with limited resources. Further,
      compact policies provide more scalable architectures for derivative-free optimization
      (DFO) in high dimensional spaces. We show that most robotics tasks from the
      OpenAI Gym can be solved using neural networks with less than 300 parameters,
      with almost linear time complexity of the inference phase, with up to 13x fewer
      parameters relative to the Evolution Strategies (ES) algorithm introduced by
      Salimans et al. (2017). We do not need heuristics such as fitness shaping to
      learn good quality policies, resulting in a simple and theoretically motivated
      training mechanism.

    abstract: We examine a class of embeddings based on structured random matrices
      with orthogonal rows which can be applied in many machine learning applications
      including dimensionality reduction and kernel approximation. For both the Johnson-Lindenstrauss
      transform and the angular kernel, we show that we can select matrices yielding
      guaranteed improved performance in accuracy and/or speed compared to earlier
      methods. We introduce matrices with complex entries which give significant further
      accuracy improvement. We provide geometric and Markov chain-based perspectives
      to help understand the benefits, and empirical results which suggest that the
      approach is helpful in a wider range of applications.

    abstract: 'The motor cortices are active during both movement and movement preparation.
      A common assumption is that preparatory activity constitutes a subthreshold
      form of movement activity: a neuron active during rightward movements becomes
      modestly active during preparation of a rightward movement. We asked whether
      this pattern of activity is, in fact, observed. We found that it was not: at
      the level of a single neuron, preparatory tuning was weakly correlated with
      movement-period tuning. Yet, somewhat paradoxically, preparatory tuning could
      be captured by a preferred direction in an abstract "space" that described the
      population-level pattern of movement activity. In fact, this relationship accounted
      for preparatory responses better than did traditional tuning models. These results
      are expected if preparatory activity provides the initial state of a dynamical
      system whose evolution produces movement activity. Our results thus suggest
      that preparatory activity may not represent specific factors, and may instead
      play a more mechanistic role.'

    abstract: We present a probabilistic kernel approach to ordinal regression based
      on Gaussian processes. A threshold model that generalizes the probit function
      is used as the likelihood function for ordinal variables. Two inference techniques,
      based on the Laplace approximation and the expectation propagation algorithm
      respectively, are derived for hyperparameter learning and model selection. We
      compare these two Gaussian process approaches with a previous ordinal regression
      method based on support vector machines on some benchmark and real-world data
      sets, including applications of ordinal regression to collaborative filtering
      and gene expression analysis. Experimental results on these data sets verify
      the usefulness of our approach.

    abstract: In multiway data, each sample is measured by multiple sets of correlated
      attributes. We develop a probabilistic framework for modeling structural dependency
      from partially observed multi-dimensional array data, known as pTucker. Latent
      components associated with individual array dimensions are jointly retrieved
      while the core tensor is integrated out. The resulting algorithm is capable
      of handling large-scale data sets. We verify the usefulness of this approach
      by comparing against classical models on applications to modeling amino acid

      data.

    abstract: 'MOTIVATION: In clinical practice, pathological phenotypes are often
      labelled with ordinal scales rather than binary, e.g. the Gleason grading system
      for tumour cell differentiation. However, in the literature of microarray analysis,
      these ordinal labels have been rarely treated in a principled way. This paper
      describes a gene selection algorithm based on Gaussian processes to discover
      consistent gene expression patterns associated with ordinal clinical phenotypes.
      The technique of automatic relevance determination is applied to represent the
      significance level of the genes in a Bayesian inference framework. RESULTS:
      The usefulness of the proposed algorithm for ordinal labels is demonstrated
      by the gene expression signature associated with the Gleason score for prostate
      cancer data. Our results demonstrate how multi-gene markers that may be initially
      developed with a diagnostic or prognostic application in mind are also useful
      as an investigative tool to reveal associations between specific molecular and
      cellular events and features of tumour physiology. Our algorithm can also be
      applied to microarray data with binary labels with results comparable to other
      methods in the literature.'

    abstract: We propose a Bayesian approach to identify protein complexes and their
      constituents from high-throughput protein-protein interaction screens. An infinite
      latent feature model that allows for multi-complex membership by individual
      proteins is coupled with a graph diffusion kernel that evaluates the likelihood
      of two proteins belonging to the same complex. Gibbs sampling is then used to
      infer a catalog of protein complexes from the interaction screen data. An advantage
      of this model is that it places no prior constraints on the number of complexes
      and automatically infers the number of significant complexes from the data.
      Validation results using affinity purification/mass spectrometry experimental
      data from yeast RNA-processing complexes indicate that our method is capable
      of partitioning the data in a biologically meaningful way. A supplementary web

    abstract: In this paper, we develop a segmental semi-Markov model (SSMM) for protein
      secondary structure prediction which incorporates multiple sequence alignment
      profiles with the purpose of improving the predictive performance. The segmental
      model is a generalization of the hidden Markov model where a hidden state generates
      segments of various length and secondary structure type. A novel parameterized
      model is proposed for the likelihood function that explicitly represents multiple
      sequence alignment profiles to capture the segmental conformation. Numerical
      results on benchmark data sets show that incorporating the profiles results
      in substantial improvements and the generalization performance is promising.
      By incorporating the information from long range interactions in beta-sheets,
      this model is also capable of carrying out inference on contact maps. This is
      an important advantage of probabilistic generative models over the traditional
      discriminative approach to protein secondary structure prediction. The Web server

    abstract: Neural responses are typically characterized by computing the mean firing
      rate, but response variability can exist across trials. Many studies have examined
      the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect
      on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly
      recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas
      spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus
      onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus
      produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed
      in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in
      correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays.
      The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether
      the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability
      decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized
      by an input.

    abstract: Recently, increased computational power and data availability, as well
      as algorithmic advances, have led machine learning techniques to impressive
      results in regression, classification, data-generation and reinforcement learning
      tasks. Despite these successes, the proximity to the physical limits of chip
      fabrication alongside the increasing size of datasets are motivating a growing
      number of researchers to explore the possibility of harnessing the power of
      quantum computation to speed-up classical machine learning algorithms. Here
      we review the literature in quantum machine learning and discuss perspectives
      for a mixed readership of classical machine learning and quantum computation
      experts. Particular emphasis will be placed on clarifying the limitations of
      quantum algorithms, how they compare with their best classical counterparts
      and why quantum resources are expected to provide advantages for learning problems.
      Learning in the presence of noise and certain computationally hard problems
      in machine learning are identified as promising directions for the field. Practical
      questions, like how to upload classical data into quantum form, will also be
      addressed.

    abstract: Machine learning training methods depend plentifully and intricately
      on hyperparameters, motivating automated strategies for their optimisation.
      Many existing algorithms restart training for each new hyperparameter choice,
      at considerable computational cost. Some hypergradient- based one-pass methods
      exist, but these either cannot be applied to arbitrary optimiser hyperparameters
      (such as learning rates and momenta) or take several times longer to train than
      their base models. We extend these existing methods to develop an approximate
      hypergradient-based hyperparameter optimiser which is applicable to any continuous
      hyperparameter appearing in a differentiable model weight update, yet requires
      only one training episode, with no restarts. We also provide a motivating argument
      for convergence to the true hypergradient, and perform tractable gradient-based
      optimisation of independent learning rates for each model parameter. Our method
      performs competitively from varied random hyperparameter initialisations on
      several UCI datasets and Fashion-MNIST (using a one-layer MLP), Penn Treebank
      (using an LSTM) and CIFAR-10 (using a ResNet-18), in time only 2-3x greater
      than vanilla training.

    abstract: Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) combine the expressive power of deep
      learning with the advantages of Bayesian formalism. In recent years, the analysis
      of wide, deep BNNs has provided theoretical insight into their priors and posteriors.
      However, we have no analogous insight into their posteriors under approximate
      inference. In this work, we show that mean-field variational inference <em>entirely
      fails to model the data</em> when the network width is large and the activation
      function is odd. Specifically, for fully-connected BNNs with odd activation
      functions and a homoscedastic Gaussian likelihood, we show that the <em>optimal</em>
      mean-field variational posterior predictive (i.e., function space) distribution
      converges to the prior predictive distribution as the width tends to infinity.
      We generalize aspects of this result to other likelihoods. Our theoretical results
      are suggestive of underfitting behavior previously observered in BNNs. While
      our convergence bounds are non-asymptotic and constants in our analysis can
      be computed, they are currently too loose to be applicable in standard training
      regimes. Finally, we show that the optimal approximate posterior need not tend
      to the prior if the activation function is not odd, showing that our statements
      cannot be generalized arbitrarily.

    abstract: The labels used to train machine learning (ML) models are of paramount
      importance. Typically for ML classification tasks, datasets contain hard labels,
      yet learning using soft labels has been shown to yield benefits for model generalization,
      robustness, and calibration. Earlier work found success in forming soft labels
      from multiple annotators' hard labels; however, this approach may not converge
      to the best labels and necessitates many annotators, which can be expensive
      and inefficient. We focus on efficiently eliciting soft labels from individual
      annotators. We collect and release a dataset of soft labels (which we call CIFAR-10S)
      over the CIFAR-10 test set via a crowdsourcing study (N=248). We demonstrate
      that learning with our labels achieves comparable model performance to prior
      approaches while requiring far fewer annotators – albeit with significant temporal
      costs per elicitation. Our elicitation methodology therefore shows nuanced promise
      in enabling practitioners to enjoy the benefits of improved model performance
      and reliability with fewer annotators, and serves as a guide for future dataset
      curators on the benefits of leveraging richer information, such as categorical
      uncertainty, from individual annotators.

    abstract: Social media's growing popularity raises concerns around children's
      online safety. Interactions between minors and adults with predatory intentions
      is a particularly grave concern. Research into online sexual grooming has often
      relied on domain experts to manually annotate conversations, limiting both scale
      and scope. In this work, we test how well-automated methods can detect conversational
      behaviors and replace an expert human annotator. Informed by psychological theories
      of online grooming, we label 6772 chat messages sent by child-sex offenders
      with one of eleven predatory behaviors. We train bag-of-words and natural language
      inference models to classify each behavior, and show that the best performing
      models classify behaviors in a manner that is consistent, but not on-par, with
      human annotation.

    abstract: Can an interviewer influence the cooperativeness of an interviewee?
      The role of an interviewer in actualising a successful interview is an active
      field of social psychological research. A large-scale analysis of interviews,
      however, typically involves time-exorbitant manual tasks and considerable human
      effort. Despite recent advances in computational fields, many automated methods
      continue to rely on manually labelled training data to establish ground-truth.
      This reliance obscures explainability and hinders the mobility of analysis between
      applications. In this work, we introduce a cross-disciplinary approach to analysing
      interviewer efficacy. We suggest computational success measures as a transparent,
      automated, and reproducible alternative for pre-labelled data. We validate these
      measures with a small-scale study with human-responders. To study the interviewer’s
      influence on the interviewee we utilise features informed by social psychological
      theory to predict interview quality based on the interviewer’s linguistic behaviour.
      Our psychologically informed model significantly outperforms a bag-of-words
      model, demonstrating the strength of a cross-disciplinary approach toward the
      analysis of conversational data at scale.

    abstract: In many settings, data is collected as multiple time series, where each
      recorded time series is an observation of some underlying dynamical process
      of interest. These observations are often time-marked with known event times,
      and one desires to do a range of standard analyses. When there is only one time
      marker, one simply aligns the observations temporally on that marker. When multiple
      time-markers are present and are at different times on different time series
      observations, these analyses are more difficult. We describe a Gaussian Process
      model for analyzing multiple time series with multiple time markings, and we
      test it on a variety of data.

    abstract: Neural prosthetic systems seek to improve the lives of severely disabled
      people by decoding neural activity into useful behavioral commands. These systems
      and their decoding algorithms are typically developed "offline", using neural
      activity previously gathered from a healthy animal, and the decoded movement
      is then compared with the true movement that accompanied the recorded neural
      activity. However, this offline design and testing may neglect important features
      of a real prosthesis, most notably the critical role of feedback control, which
      enables the user to adjust neural activity while using the prosthesis. We hypothesize
      that under- standing and optimally designing high-performance decoders require
      an experimental platform where humans are in closed-loop with the various candidate
      decode systems and algorithms. It remains unexplored the extent to which the
      subject can, for a particular decode system, algorithm, or parameter, engage
      feedback and other strategies to improve decode performance. Closed-loop testing
      may suggest different choices than offline analyses. Here we ask if a healthy
      human subject, using a closed-loop neural prosthesis driven by synthetic neural
      activity, can inform system design. We use this online pros- thesis simulator
      (OPS) to optimize "online" decode performance based on a key parameter of a
      current state-of-the-art decode algorithm, the bin width of a Kalman filter.
      First, we show that offline and online analyses indeed suggest different parameter
      choices. Previous literature and our offline analyses agree that neural activity
      should be analyzed in bins of 100- to 300-ms width. OPS analysis, which incorporates
      feedback control, suggests that much shorter bin widths (25-50 ms) yield higher
      decode performance. Second, we confirm this surprising finding using a closed-loop
      rhesus monkey prosthetic system. These findings illustrate the type of discovery
      made possible by the OPS, and so we hypothesize that this novel testing approach
      will help in the design of prosthetic systems that will translate well to human
      patients.

    abstract: Point processes are difficult to analyze because they provide only a
      sparse and noisy observation of the intensity function driving the process.
      Gaussian Processes offer an attractive framework within which to infer underlying
      intensity functions. The result of this inference is a continuous function defined
      across time that is typically more amenable to analytical efforts. However,
      a naive implementation will become computationally infeasible in any problem
      of reasonable size, both in memory and run time requirements. We demonstrate
      problem specific methods for a class of renewal processes that eliminate the
      memory burden and reduce the solve time by orders of magnitude.

    abstract: Neural spike trains present challenges to analytical efforts due to
      their noisy, spiking nature. Many studies of neuroscientific and neural prosthetic
      importance rely on a smoothed, denoised estimate of the spike train's underlying
      firing rate. Current techniques to find time-varying firing rates require ad
      hoc choices of parameters, offer no confidence intervals on their estimates,
      and can obscure potentially important single trial variability. We present a
      new method, based on a Gaussian Process prior, for inferring probabilistically
      optimal estimates of firing rate functions underlying single or multiple neural
      spike trains. We test the performance of the method on simulated data and experimentally
      gathered neural spike trains, and we demonstrate improvements over conventional
      estimators.

    abstract: In reinforcement learning an agent interacts with the environment by
      taking actions and observing the next state and reward. When sampled probabilistically,
      these state transitions, rewards, and actions can all induce randomness in the
      observed long-term return. Traditionally, reinforcement learning algorithms
      average over this randomness to estimate the value function. In this paper,
      we build on recent work advocating a distributional approach to reinforcement
      learning in which the distribution over returns is modeled explicitly instead
      of only estimating the mean. That is, we examine methods of learning the value
      distribution instead of the value function. We give results that close a number
      of gaps between the theoretical and algorithmic results given by Bellemare,
      Dabney, and Munos (2017). First, we extend existing results to the approximate
      distribution setting. Second, we present a novel distributional reinforcement
      learning algorithm consistent with our theoretical formulation. Finally, we
      evaluate this new algorithm on the Atari 2600 games, observing that it significantly
      outperforms many of the recent improvements on DQN, including the related distributional
      algorithm C51.

    abstract: 'The Bayesian paradigm has the potential to solve core issues of deep

      In this work, we show that it suffices to perform inference over a small subset

      weights are kept as point estimates. This subnetwork inference framework enables
      us to use expressive, otherwise intractable, posterior approximations over such

      obtain a MAP estimate of all weights and then infer a full-covariance Gaussian
      posterior over a subnetwork. We propose a subnetwork selection strategy that
      aims to maximally preserve the model''s predictive uncertainty. Empirically,

    abstract: In many research areas, including control and medical applications,
      we face decision-making problems where data are limited and/or the underlying
      generative process is complicated and partially unknown. In these scenarios,
      we can profit from algorithms that learn from data and aid decision making.<br>
      Reinforcement learning (RL) is a general computational approach to experience-based
      goal-directed learning for sequential decision making under uncertainty. However,
      RL often lacks efficiency in terms of the number of required trials when no
      task-specific knowledge is available. This lack of efficiency makes RL often
      inapplicable to (optimal) control problems. Thus, a central issue in RL is to
      speed up learning by extracting more information from available experience.<br>
      The contributions of this dissertation are threefold:<br> 1. We propose PILCO,
      a fully Bayesian approach for efficient RL in continuous-valued state and action
      spaces when no expert knowledge is available. PILCO is based on well-established
      ideas from statistics and machine learning. PILCO's key ingredient is a probabilistic
      dynamics model learned from data, which is implemented by a Gaussian process
      (GP). The GP carefully quantifies knowledge by a probability distribution over
      plausible dynamics models. By averaging over all these models during long-term
      planning and decision making, PILCO takes uncertainties into account in a principled
      way and, therefore, reduces model bias, a central problem in model-based RL.<br>
      2. Due to its generality and efficiency, PILCO can be considered a conceptual
      and practical approach to jointly learning models and controllers when expert
      knowledge is difficult to obtain or simply not available. For this scenario,
      we investigate PILCO's properties its applicability to challenging real and
      simulated nonlinear control problems. For example, we consider the tasks of
      learning to swing up a double pendulum attached to a cart or to balance a unicycle
      with five degrees of freedom. Across all tasks we report unprecedented automation
      and an unprecedented learning efficiency for solving these tasks.<br> 3. As
      a step toward pilco's extension to partially observable Markov decision processes,
      we propose a principled algorithm for robust filtering and smoothing in GP dynamic
      systems. Unlike commonly used Gaussian filters for nonlinear systems, it does
      neither rely on function linearization nor on finite-sample representations
      of densities. Our algorithm profits from exact moment matching for predictions
      while keeping all computations analytically tractable. We present experimental
      evidence that demonstrates the robustness and the advantages of our method over
      unscented Kalman filters, the cubature Kalman filter, and the extended Kalman
      filter.

    abstract: Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics
      for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount
      of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement
      learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system
      to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such
      as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To
      address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-speciﬁc
      knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped
      policies, or speciﬁc knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this article,
      we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information
      from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian
      process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty
      into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects
      of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the
      art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed
      of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real
      robot and control tasks.

    abstract: We propose an analytic moment-based filter for nonlinear stochastic
      dynamic systems modeled by Gaussian processes. Exact expressions for the expected
      value and the covariance matrix are provided for both the prediction step and
      the filter step, where an additional Gaussian assumption is exploited in the
      latter case. Our filter does not require further approximations. In particular,
      it avoids finite-sample approximations. We compare the filter to a variety of

    abstract: In general, it is difficult to determine an optimal closed-loop policy
      in nonlinear control problems with continuous-valued state and control domains.
      Hence, approximations are often inevitable. The standard method of discretizing
      states and controls suffers from the curse of dimensionality and strongly depends
      on the chosen temporal sampling rate. The paper introduces Gaussian Process
      Dynamic Programming (GPDP). In GPDP, value functions in the Bellman recursion
      of the dynamic programming algorithm are modeled using Gaussian processes. GPDP
      returns an optimal state-feedback for a finite set of states. Based on these
      outcomes, we learn a possibly discontinuous closed-loop policy on the entire
      state space by switching between two independently trained Gaussian processes.

    abstract: Over the last years, there has been substantial progress in robust manipulation
      in unstructured environments. The long-term goal of our work is to get away
      from precise, but very expensive robotic systems and to develop affordable,
      potentially imprecise, self-adaptive manipulator systems that can interactively
      perform tasks such as playing with children. In this paper, we demonstrate how
      a low-cost off-the-shelf robotic system can learn closed-loop policies for a
      stacking task in only a handful of trials - from scratch. Our manipulator is
      inaccurate and provides no pose feedback. For learning a controller in the work
      space of a Kinect-style depth camera, we use a model-based reinforcement learning
      technique. Our learning method is data efficient, reduces model bias, and deals
      with several noise sources in a principled way during long-term planning. We
      present a way of incorporating state-space constraints into the learning process
      and analyze the learning gain by exploiting the sequential structure of the
      stacking task.

    abstract: Finding an optimal policy in a reinforcement learning (RL) framework
      with continuous state and action spaces is challenging. Approximate solutions
      are often inevitable. GPDP is an approximate dynamic programming algorithm based
      on Gaussian process (GP) models for the value functions. In this paper, we extend
      GPDP to the case of unknown transition dynamics. After building a GP model for
      the transition dynamics, we apply GPDP to this model and determine a continuous-valued
      policy in the entire state space. We apply the resulting controller to the underpowered
      pendulum swing up. Moreover, we compare our results on this RL task to a nearly
      optimal discrete DP solution in a fully known environment.

  DeiRasPet09:
    abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control of systems with continuous
      states and actions require approximation techniques in most interesting cases.
      In this article, we introduce Gaussian process dynamic programming (GPDP), an
      approximate value function-based RL algorithm. We consider both a classic optimal
      control problem, where problem-specific prior knowledge is available, and a
      classic RL problem, where only very general priors can be used. For the classic
      optimal control problem, GPDP models the unknown value functions with Gaussian
      processes and generalizes dynamic programming to continuous-valued states and
      actions. For the RL problem, GPDP starts from a given initial state and explores
      the state space using Bayesian active learning. To design a fast learner, available
      data have to be used efficiently. Hence, we propose to learn probabilistic models
      of the a priori unknown transition dynamics and the value functions on the fly.
      In both cases, we successfully apply the resulting continuous-valued controllers
      to the under-actuated pendulum swing up and analyze the performances of the
      suggested algorithms. It turns out that GPDP uses data very efficiently and
      can be applied to problems, where classic dynamic programming would be cumbersome.

    abstract: We propose a principled algorithm for robust Bayesian filtering and
      smoothing in nonlinear stochastic dynamic systems when both the transition function
      and the measurement function are described by nonparametric Gaussian process
      (GP) models. GPs are gaining increasing importance in signal processing, machine
      learning, robotics, and control for representing unknown system functions by
      posterior probability distributions. This modern way of "system identification"
      is more robust than finding point estimates of a parametric function representation.
      Our principled filtering/smoothing approach for GP dynamic systems is based
      on analytic moment matching in the context of the forward-backward algorithm.
      Our numerical evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach
      in situations where other state-of-the-art Gaussian filters and smoothers can
      fail.

    abstract: Transparency of algorithmic systems has been discussed as a way for
      end-users and regulators to develop appropriate trust in machine learning models.
      One popular approach, LIME [26], even suggests that model explanations can answer
      the question “Why should I trust you?” Here we show a straightforward method
      for modifying a pre-trained model to manipulate the output of many popular feature
      importance explanation methods with little change in accuracy, thus demonstrating
      the danger of trusting such explanation methods. We show how this explanation
      attack can mask a model’s discriminatory use of a sensitive feature, raising
      strong concerns about using such explanation methods to check model fairness.

    abstract: 'Many unsupervised learning problems seek to identify hidden features
      from observations. In many real-world situations, the number of hidden features
      is unknown. To avoid specifying the number of hidden features a priori, one
      can use the Indian Buffet Process (IBP): a nonparametric latent feature model
      that does not bound the number of active features in a dataset. While elegant,
      the lack of efficient inference procedures for the IBP has prevented its application
      in large-scale problems. The core contribution of this thesis are three new
      inference procedures that allow inference in the IBP to be scaled from a few
      hundred to 100,000 observations. This thesis contains three parts: (1) An introduction
      to the IBP and a review of inference techniques and extensions. The first chapters
      summarise three constructions for the IBP and review all currently published
      inference techniques. Appendix C reviews extensions of the IBP to date. (2)
      Novel techniques for scalable Bayesian inference. This thesis presents three
      new inference procedures: (a) an accelerated Gibbs sampler for efficient Bayesian
      inference in a broad class of conjugate models, (b) a parallel, asynchronous
      Gibbs sampler that allows the accelerated Gibbs sampler to be distributed across
      multiple processors, and (c) a variational inference procedure for the IBP.
      (3) A framework for structured nonparametric latent feature models. We also
      present extensions to the IBP to model more sophisticated relationships between
      the co-occurring hidden features, providing a general framework for correlated
      non-parametric feature models.'

    abstract: The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework has
      proven useful in planning domains where agents must balance actions that provide
      knowledge and actions that provide reward. Unfortunately, most POMDPs are complex
      structures with a large number of parameters. In many real-world problems, both
      the structure and the parameters are difficult to specify from domain knowledge
      alone. Recent work in Bayesian reinforcement learning has made headway in learning
      POMDP models; however, this work has largely focused on learning the parameters
      of the POMDP model. We define an infinite POMDP (iPOMDP) model that does not
      require knowledge of the size of the state space; instead, it assumes that the
      number of visited states will grow as the agent explores its world and only
      models visited states explicitly. We demonstrate the iPOMDP on several standard
      problems.

    abstract: It is commonly stated that reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms learn
      slower than humans. In this work, we investigate this claim using two standard
      problems from the RL literature. We compare the performance of human subjects
      to RL techniques. We find that context—the meaningfulness of the observations—–plays
      a significant role in the rate of human RL. Moreover, without contextual information,
      humans often fare much worse than classic algorithms. Comparing the detailed
      responses of humans and RL algorithms, we also find that humans appear to employ
      rather different strategies from standard algorithms, even in cases where they
      had indistinguishable performance to them. Our research both sheds light on
      human RL and provides insights for improving RL algorithms.

      on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows
      data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel
      MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message
      passing to compute the global likelihoods and posteriors. This algorithm, the
      first parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders
      of magnitude larger than have previously been possible.

    abstract: The Indian Buffet Process (IBP) is a nonparametric prior for latent
      feature models in which observations are influenced by a combination of hidden
      features. For example, images may be composed of several objects and sounds
      may consist of several notes. Latent feature models seek to infer these unobserved
      features from a set of observations; the IBP provides a principled prior in
      situations where the number of hidden features is unknown. Current inference
      methods for the IBP have all relied on sampling. While these methods are guaranteed
      to be accurate in the limit, samplers for the IBP tend to mix slowly in practice.
      We develop a deterministic variational method for inference in the IBP based
      on a truncated stick-breaking approximation, provide theoretical bounds on the
      truncation error, and evaluate our method in several data regimes.

    abstract: Spoken language is one of the most intuitive forms of interaction between
      humans and agents. Unfortunately, agents that interact with people using natural
      language often experience communication errors and do not correctly understand
      the user's intentions. Recent systems have successfully used probabilistic models
      of speech, language, and user behavior to generate robust dialog performance
      in the presence of noisy speech recognition and ambiguous language choices,
      but decisions made using these probabilistic models are still prone to errors
      due to the complexity of acquiring and maintaining a complete model of human
      language and behavior. In this paper, we describe a decision-theoretic model
      for human-robot interaction using natural language. Our algorithm is based on
      the Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which allows agents
      to choose actions that are robust not only to uncertainty from noisy or ambiguous
      speech recognition but also unknown user models. Like most dialog systems, a
      POMDP is defined by a large number of parameters that may be difficult to specify
      a priori from domain knowledge, and learning these parameters from the user
      may require an unacceptably long training period. We describe an extension to
      the POMDP model that allows the agent to acquire a linguistic model of the user
      online, including new vocabulary and word choice preferences. Our approach not
      only avoids a training period of constant questioning as the agent learns, but
      also allows the agent to actively query for additional information when its
      uncertainty suggests a high risk of mistakes. We demonstrate our approach both
      in simulation and on a natural language interaction system for a robotic wheelchair
      application.

    abstract: We introduce a new class of inter-domain variational Gaussian processes
      (GP) where data is mapped onto the unit hypersphere in order to use spherical
      harmonic representations. Our inference scheme is comparable to variational
      Fourier features, but it does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, and
      leads to diagonal covariance matrices between inducing variables. This enables
      a speed-up in inference, because it bypasses the need to invert large covariance
      matrices. Our experiments show that our model is able to fit a regression model
      for a dataset with 6 million entries two orders of magnitude faster compared
      to standard sparse GPs, while retaining state of the art accuracy. We also demonstrate
      competitive performance on classification with non-conjugate likelihoods.

    abstract: Neural networks and Gaussian processes are complementary in their strengths
      and weaknesses. Having a better understanding of their relationship comes with
      the promise to make each method benefit from the strengths of the other. In
      this work, we establish an equivalence between the forward passes of neural
      networks and (deep) sparse Gaussian process models. The theory we develop is
      based on interpreting activation functions as interdomain inducing features
      through a rigorous analysis of the interplay between activation functions and
      kernels. This results in models that can either be seen as neural networks with
      improved uncertainty prediction or deep Gaussian processes with increased prediction
      accuracy. These claims are supported by experimental results on regression and
      classification datasets.

    abstract: Conditional Density Estimation (CDE) models deal with estimating conditional
      distributions. The conditions imposed on the distribution are the inputs of
      the model. CDE is a challenging task as there is a fundamental trade-off between
      model complexity, representational capacity and overfitting. In this work, we
      propose to extend the model's input with latent variables and use Gaussian processes
      (GP) to map this augmented input onto samples from the conditional distribution.
      Our Bayesian approach allows for the modeling of small datasets, but we also
      provide the machinery for it to be applied to big data using stochastic variational
      inference. Our approach can be used to model densities even in sparse data regions,
      and allows for sharing learned structure between conditions. We illustrate the
      effectiveness and wide-reaching applicability of our model on a variety of real-
      world problems, such as spatio-temporal density estimation of taxi drop-offs,
      non-Gaussian noise modeling, and few-shot learning on omniglot images.

    abstract: Gaussian processes provide an elegant framework for specifying prior
      and posterior distributions over functions. They are, however, also computationally
      expensive, and limited by the expressivity of their covariance function. We
      propose Neural Diffusion Processes (NDPs), a novel approach based upon diffusion
      models, that learn to sample from distributions over functions. Using a novel
      attention block, we can incorporate properties of stochastic processes, such
      as exchangeability, directly into the NDP's architecture. We empirically show
      that NDPs are able to capture functional distributions that are close to the
      true Bayesian posterior of a Gaussian process. This enables a variety of downstream
      tasks, including hyperparameter marginalisation and Bayesian optimisation.

    abstract: Despite its importance, choosing the structural form of the kernel in
      nonparametric regression remains a black art. We define a space of kernel structures
      which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of
      base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures
      which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often
      decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation
      on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely
      used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.

    abstract: We introduce a Gaussian process model of functions which are additive.
      An additive function is one which decomposes into a sum of low-dimensional functions,
      each depending on only a subset of the input variables. Additive GPs generalize
      both Generalized Additive Models, and the standard GP models which use squared-exponential
      kernels. Hyperparameter learning in this model can be seen as Bayesian Hierarchical
      Kernel Learning (HKL). We introduce an expressive but tractable parameterization
      of the kernel function, which allows efficient evaluation of all input interaction
      terms, whose number is exponential in the input dimension. The additional structure
      discoverable by this model results in increased interpretability, as well as
      state-of-the-art predictive power in regression tasks.

    abstract: Choosing appropriate architectures and regularization strategies for
      deep networks is crucial to good predictive performance. To shed light on this
      problem, we analyze the analogous problem of constructing useful priors on compositions
      of functions. Specifically, we study the deep Gaussian process, a type of infinitely-wide,
      deep neural network. We show that in standard architectures, the representational
      capacity of the network tends to capture fewer degrees of freedom as the number
      of layers increases, retaining only a single degree of freedom in the limit.
      We propose an alternate network architecture which does not suffer from this
      pathology. We also examine deep covariance functions, obtained by composing
      infinitely many feature transforms. Lastly, we characterize the class of models
      obtained by performing dropout on Gaussian processes.

    abstract: We consider training a deep neural network to generate samples from
      an unknown distribution given i.i.d. data. We frame learning as an optimization
      minimizing a two-sample test statistic—informally speaking, a good generator
      network produces samples that cause a two-sample test to fail to reject the
      null hypothesis. As our two-sample test statistic, we use an unbiased estimate
      of the maximum mean discrepancy, which is the centerpiece of the nonparametric
      kernel two-sample test proposed by Gretton et al. (2012). We compare to the
      adversarial nets framework introduced by Goodfellow et al. (2014), in which
      learning is a two-player game between a generator network and an adversarial
      discriminator network, both trained to outwit the other. From this perspective,
      the MMD statistic plays the role of the discriminator. In addition to empirical
      comparisons, we prove bounds on the generalization error incurred by optimizing
      the empirical MMD.

    abstract: 'Domain generalization (DG) seeks predictors which perform well on unseen
      test distributions by leveraging data drawn from multiple related training distributions
      or domains. To achieve this, DG is commonly formulated as an average- or worst-case
      problem over the set of possible domains. However, predictors that perform well
      on average lack robustness while predictors that perform well in the worst case
      tend to be overly-conservative. To address this, we propose a new probabilistic
      framework for DG where the goal is to learn predictors that perform well with
      high probability. Our key idea is that distribution shifts seen during training
      should inform us of probable shifts at test time, which we realize by explicitly
      relating training and test domains as draws from the same underlying meta-distribution.
      To achieve probable DG, we propose a new optimization problem called Quantile
      Risk Minimization (QRM). By minimizing the α-quantile of predictor''s risk distribution
      over domains, QRM seeks predictors that perform well with probability α. To
      solve QRM in practice, we propose the Empirical QRM (EQRM) algorithm, and prove:
      (i) a generalization bound for EQRM; and (ii) that EQRM recovers the causal
      predictor as α->1. In our experiments, we introduce a more holistic quantile-focused
      evaluation protocol for DG, and demonstrate that EQRM outperforms state-of-the-art
      baselines on CMNIST and several datasets from WILDS and DomainBed.'

    abstract: In this paper we propose an algorithm for approximate inference on graphical
      models based on belief propagation (BP). Our algorithm is an approximate version
      of Cutset Conditioning, in which a subset of variables is instantiated to make
      the rest of the graph singly connected. We relax the constraint of single-connectedness,
      and select variables one at a time for conditioning, running belief propagation
      after each selection. We consider the problem of determining the best variable
      to clamp at each level of recursion, and propose a fast heuristic which applies
      back-propagation to the BP updates. We demonstrate that the heuristic performs
      better than selecting variables at random, and give experimental results which
      show that it performs competitively with existing approximate inference algorithms.

    abstract: We offer a solution to the problem of efficiently translating algorithms
      between different types of discrete statistical model. We investigate the expressive
      power of three classes of model-those with binary variables, with pairwise factors,
      and with planar topology-as well as their four intersections. We formalize a
      notion of "simple reduction" for the problem of inferring marginal probabilities
      and consider whether it is possible to "simply reduce" marginal inference from
      general discrete factor graphs to factor graphs in each of these seven subclasses.
      We characterize the reducibility of each class, showing in particular that the
      class of binary pairwise factor graphs is able to simply reduce only positive
      models. We also exhibit a continuous "spectral reduction" based on polynomial
      interpolation, which overcomes this limitation. Experiments assess the performance
      of standard approximate inference algorithms on the outputs of our reductions.

      based on data from cortical recordings. The task is to predict the orientation
      of visual stimuli from the activity of a population of simultaneously recorded
      neurons. We compare several ways of improving the coding of the input (i.e.,
      the spike data) as well as of the output (i.e., the orientation), and report

    abstract: Deep reinforcement learning algorithms can learn complex behavioral
      skills, but real-world application of these methods requires a large amount
      of experience to be collected by the agent. In practical settings, such as robotics,
      this involves repeatedly attempting a task, resetting the environment between
      each attempt. However, not all tasks are easily or automatically reversible.
      In practice, this learning process requires extensive human intervention. In
      this work, we propose an autonomous method for safe and efficient reinforcement
      learning that simultaneously learns a forward and reset policy, with the reset
      policy resetting the environment for a subsequent attempt. By learning a value
      function for the reset policy, we can automatically determine when the forward
      policy is about to enter a non-reversible state, providing for uncertainty-aware
      safety aborts. Our experiments illustrate that proper use of the reset policy
      can greatly reduce the number of manual resets required to learn a task, can
      reduce the number of unsafe actions that lead to non-reversible states, and
      can automatically induce a curriculum.

    abstract: In this paper we investigate the stick-breaking representation for the
      class of sigma-Stable Poisson-Kingman models, also known as Gibbs-type random
      probability measures. This class includes as special cases most of the discrete
      priors commonly used in Bayesian nonparametrics, such as the two parameter Poisson-Dirichlet
      process and the normalized generalized Gamma process. Under the assumption sigma=u/v,
      for any coprime integers 1    lt= u    lt v such that u/v    lt 1/2, we show
      that a sigma-stable Poisson-Kingman model admits an explicit stick-breaking
      representation in terms of random variables which are obtained by suitably transforming
      Gamma random variables and products of independent Beta and Gamma random variables.

    abstract: We investigate the use of a large class of discrete random probability
      measures, which is referred to as the class Q, , in the context of Bayesian
      nonparametric mixture modeling. The class Q encompasses both the the two-parameter
      Poisson?Dirichlet process and the normalized generalized Gamma process, thus
      allowing us to comparatively study the inferential advantages of these two well-known
      nonparametric priors. Apart from ahighly flexible parameterization, the distinguishing
      feature of the class Q is the availability of a tractable posterior distribution.
      This feature, in turn, leads to derive an efficient marginal MCMC algorithm
      for posterior sampling within the framework of mixture models. We demonstrate
      the efficacy of our modeling framework on both one-dimensional and multi-dimensional
      datasets.

    abstract: Relative entropy coding (REC) algorithms encode a sample from a target
      distribution Q using a proposal distribution P, such that the expected codelength
      is 𝒪(D_KL[Q||P]). REC can be seamlessly integrated with existing learned compression
      models since, unlike entropy coding, it does not assume discrete Q or P, and
      does not require quantisation. However, general REC algorithms require an intractable
      Ω(e^D_KL[Q||P]) runtime. We introduce AS* and AD* coding, two REC algorithms
      based on A* sampling. We prove that, for continuous distributions over ℝ, if
      the density ratio is unimodal, AS* has 𝒪(D_∞[Q||P]QP) expected runtime, where
      D_∞[Q||P]QP is the Rényi ∞-divergence. We provide experimental evidence that
      AD* also has 𝒪(D_∞[Q||P]QP) expected runtime. We prove that AS* and AD* achieve
      an expected codelength of 𝒪(D_KL[Q||P]). Further, we introduce DAD*, an approximate
      algorithm based on AD* which retains its favourable runtime and has bias similar
      to that of alternative methods. Focusing on VAEs, we propose the IsoKL VAE (IKVAE),
      which can be used with DAD* to further improve compression efficiency. We evaluate
      A* coding with (IK)VAEs on MNIST, showing that it can losslessly compress images
      near the theoretically optimal limit.

    abstract: 'In this paper, we investigate the question: Given a small number of
      datapoints, for example N = 30, how tight can PAC-Bayes and test set bounds
      be made? For such small datasets, test set bounds adversely affect generalisation
      performance by withholding data from the training procedure. In this setting,
      PAC-Bayes bounds are especially attractive, due to their ability to use all
      the data to simultaneously learn a posterior and bound its generalisation risk.
      We focus on the case of i.i.d. data with a bounded loss and consider the generic
      PAC-Bayes theorem of Germain et al. While their theorem is known to recover
      many existing PAC-Bayes bounds, it is unclear what the tightest bound derivable
      from their framework is. For a fixed learning algorithm and dataset, we show
      that the tightest possible bound coincides with a bound considered by Catoni;
      and, in the more natural case of distributions over datasets, we establish a
      lower bound on the best bound achievable in expectation. Interestingly, this
      lower bound recovers the Chernoff test set bound if the posterior is equal to
      the prior. Moreover, to illustrate how tight these bounds can be, we study synthetic
      one-dimensional classification tasks in which it is feasible to meta-learn both
      the prior and the form of the bound to numerically optimise for the tightest
      bounds possible. We ind that in this simple, controlled scenario, PAC-Bayes
      bounds are competitive with comparable, commonly used Chernoff test set bounds.
      However, the sharpest test set bounds still lead to better guarantees on the
      generalisation error than the PAC-Bayes bounds we consider.'

    abstract: Stationary stochastic processes (SPs) are a key component of many probabilistic
      models, such as those for off-the-grid spatio-temporal data. They enable the
      statistical symmetry of underlying physical phenomena to be leveraged, thereby
      aiding generalization. Prediction in such models can be viewed as a translation
      equivariant map from observed data sets to predictive SPs, emphasizing the intimate
      relationship between stationarity and equivariance. Building on this, we propose
      the Convolutional Neural Process (ConvNP), which endows Neural Processes (NPs)
      with translation equivariance and extends convolutional conditional NPs to allow
      for dependencies in the predictive distribution. The latter enables ConvNPs
      to be deployed in settings which require coherent samples, such as Thompson
      sampling or conditional image completion. Moreover, we propose a new maximum-likelihood
      objective to replace the standard ELBO objective in NPs, which conceptually
      simplifies the framework and empirically improves performance. We demonstrate
      the strong performance and generalization capabilities of ConvNPs on 1D regression,
      image completion, and various tasks with real-world spatio-temporal data.

    abstract: Uncertainty estimation in deep learning has recently emerged as a crucial
      area of interest to advance reliability and robustness in safety-critical applications.
      While there have been many proposed methods that either focus on distance-aware
      model uncertainties for out-of-distribution detection or on input-dependent
      label uncertainties for in-distribution calibration, both of these types of
      uncertainty are often necessary. In this work, we propose the HetSNGP method
      for jointly modeling the model and data uncertainty. We show that our proposed
      model affords a favorable combination between these two types of uncertainty
      and thus outperforms the baseline methods on some challenging out-of-distribution
      datasets, including CIFAR-100C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-A. Moreover, we propose
      HetSNGP Ensemble, an ensembled version of our method which additionally models
      uncertainty over the network parameters and outperforms other ensemble baselines.

    abstract: Isotropic Gaussian priors are the de facto standard for modern Bayesian
      neural network inference. However, it is unclear whether these priors accurately
      reflect our true beliefs about the weight distributions or give optimal performance.
      To find better priors, we study summary statistics of neural network weights
      in networks trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We find that convolutional
      neural network (CNN) and ResNet weights display strong spatial correlations,
      while fully connected networks (FCNNs) display heavy-tailed weight distributions.
      We show that building these observations into priors can lead to improved performance
      on a variety of image classification datasets. Surprisingly, these priors mitigate
      the cold posterior effect in FCNNs, but slightly increase the cold posterior
      effect in ResNets.

      with a large prior variance. The regularization term is computed from unlabelled
      input data that characterizes the input distribution. Tests on two datasets

    abstract: 'The analysis of time series data is important in fields as disparate
      as the social sciences, biology, engineering or econometrics. In this dissertation,
      we present a number of algorithms designed to learn Bayesian nonparametric models
      of time series. The goal of these kinds of models is twofold. First, they aim
      at making predictions which quantify the uncertainty due to limitations in the
      quantity and the quality of the data. Second, they are flexible enough to model
      highly complex data whilst preventing overfitting when the data does not warrant
      complex models.</br> We begin with a unifying literature review on time series
      models based on Gaussian processes. Then, we centre our attention on the Gaussian
      Process State-Space Model (GP-SSM): a Bayesian nonparametric generalisation
      of discrete-time nonlinear state-space models. We present a novel formulation
      of the GP-SSM that offers new insights into its properties. We then proceed
      to exploit those insights by developing new learning algorithms for the GP-SSM
      based on particle Markov chain Monte Carlo and variational inference.</br> Finally,
      we present a filtered nonlinear auto-regressive model with a simple, robust
      and fast learning algorithm that makes it well suited to its application by
      non-experts on large datasets. Its main advantage is that it avoids the computationally

      instead infer directly the joint smoothing distribution through the use of specially
      tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the
      smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution
      can be formulated analytically. We make use of sparse Gaussian process models
      to greatly reduce the computational complexity of the approach.

    abstract: Gaussian process state-space models (GP-SSMs) are a very flexible family
      of models of nonlinear dynamical systems. They comprise a Bayesian nonparametric
      representation of the dynamics of the system and additional (hyper-)parameters
      governing the properties of this nonparametric representation. The Bayesian
      formalism enables systematic reasoning about the uncertainty in the system dynamics.
      We present an approach to maximum likelihood identification of the parameters
      in GP-SSMs, while retaining the full nonparametric description of the dynamics.
      The method is based on a stochastic approximation version of the EM algorithm
      that employs recent developments in particle Markov chain Monte Carlo for efficient
      identification.

    abstract: Recent work done by Lovell, Adams, and Mansingka (2012) and Williamson,
      Dubey, and Xing (2013) has suggested an alternative parametrisation for the
      Dirichlet process in order to derive non-approximate parallel MCMC inference
      for it – work which has been picked-up and implemented in several different
      fields. In this paper we show that the approach suggested is impractical due
      to an extremely unbalanced distribution of the data. We characterise the requirements
      of efficient parallel inference for the Dirichlet process and show that the
      proposed inference fails most of these requirements (while approximate approaches
      often satisfy most of them). We present both theoretical and experimental evidence,
      analysing the load balance for the inference and showing that it is independent
      of the size of the dataset and the number of nodes available in the parallel
      implementation. We end with suggestions of alternative paths of research for
      efficient non-approximate parallel inference for the Dirichlet process.

    abstract: The dominant yet ageing IBM and HMM word alignment models underpin most
      popular Statistical Machine Translation implementations in use today. Though
      beset by the limitations of implausible independence assumptions, intractable
      optimisation problems, and an excess of tunable parameters, these models provide
      a scalable and reliable starting point for inducing translation systems. In
      this paper we build upon this venerable base by recasting these models in the
      non-parametric Bayesian framework. By replacing the categorical distributions
      at their core with hierarchical Pitman-Yor processes, and through the use of
      collapsed Gibbs sampling, we provide a more flexible formulation and sidestep
      the original heuristic optimisation techniques. The resulting models are highly
      extendible, naturally permitting the introduction of phrasal dependencies. We
      present extensive experimental results showing improvements in both AER and
      BLEU when benchmarked against Giza++, including significant improvements over
      IBM model 4.

    Title: Latent Gaussian Processes for Distribution Estimation of Multivariate Categorical
      Data
    abstract: Multivariate categorical data occur in many applications of machine
      learning. One of the main difficulties with these vectors of categorical variables
      is sparsity. The number of possible observations grows exponentially with vector
      length, but dataset diversity might be poor in comparison. Recent models have
      gained significant improvement in supervised tasks with this data. These models
      embed observations in a continuous space to capture similarities between them.
      Building on these ideas we propose a Bayesian model for the unsupervised task
      of distribution estimation of multivariate categorical data. We model vectors
      of categorical variables as generated from a non-linear transformation of a
      continuous latent space. Non-linearity captures multi-modality in the distribution.
      The continuous representation addresses sparsity. Our model ties together many
      existing models, linking the linear categorical latent Gaussian model, the Gaussian
      process latent variable model, and Gaussian process classification. We derive
      inference for our model based on recent developments in sampling based variational
      inference. We show empirically that the model outperforms its linear and discrete
      counterparts in imputation tasks of sparse data.

    abstract: Dropout is used as a practical tool to obtain uncertainty estimates
      in large vision models and reinforcement learning (RL) tasks. But to obtain
      well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, a grid-search over the dropout probabilities
      is necessary—a prohibitive operation with large models, and an impossible one
      with RL. We propose a new dropout variant which gives improved performance and
      better calibrated uncertainties. Relying on recent developments in Bayesian
      deep learning, we use a continuous relaxation of dropout's discrete masks. Together
      with a principled optimisation objective, this allows for automatic tuning of
      the dropout probability in large models, and as a result faster experimentation
      cycles. In RL this allows the agent to adapt its uncertainty dynamically as
      more data is observed. We analyse the proposed variant extensively on a range
      of tasks, and give insights into common practice in the field where larger dropout
      probabilities are often used in deeper model layers.

    Title: Improving the Gaussian Process Sparse Spectrum Approximation by Representing
      Uncertainty in Frequency Inputs
    abstract: Standard sparse pseudo-input approximations to the Gaussian process
      (GP) cannot handle complex functions well. Sparse spectrum alternatives attempt
      to answer this but are known to over-fit. We suggest the use of variational
      inference for the sparse spectrum approximation to avoid both issues. We model
      the covariance function with a finite Fourier series approximation and treat
      it as a random variable. The random covariance function has a posterior, on
      which a variational distribution is placed. The variational distribution transforms
      the random covariance function to fit the data. We study the properties of our
      approximate inference, compare it to alternative ones, and extend it to the
      distributed and stochastic domains. Our approximation captures complex functions
      better than standard approaches and avoids over-fitting.

    abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are a powerful tool for probabilistic inference
      over functions. They have been applied to both regression and non-linear dimensionality
      reduction, and offer desirable properties such as uncertainty estimates, robustness
      to over-fitting, and principled ways for tuning hyper-parameters. However the
      scalability of these models to big datasets remains an active topic of research.
      We introduce a novel re-parametrisation of variational inference for sparse
      GP regression and latent variable models that allows for an efficient distributed
      algorithm. This is done by exploiting the decoupling of the data given the inducing
      points to re-formulate the evidence lower bound in a Map-Reduce setting. We
      show that the inference scales well with data and computational resources, while
      preserving a balanced distribution of the load among the nodes. We further demonstrate
      the utility in scaling Gaussian processes to big data. We show that GP performance
      improves with increasing amounts of data in regression (on flight data with
      2 million records) and latent variable modelling (on MNIST). The results show
      that GPs perform better than many common models often used for big data.

    abstract: In the last few years, machine learning techniques, in particular convolutional
      neural networks, have been investigated as a method to replace or complement
      traditional matched filtering techniques that are used to detect the gravitational-wave
      signature of merging black holes. However, to date, these methods have not yet
      been successfully applied to the analysis of long stretches of data recorded
      by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories. In this work,
      we critically examine the use of convolutional neural networks as a tool to
      search for merging black holes. We identify the strengths and limitations of
      this approach, highlight some common pitfalls in translating between machine
      learning and gravitational-wave astronomy, and discuss the interdisciplinary
      challenges. In particular, we explain in detail why convolutional neural networks
      alone cannot be used to claim a statistically significant gravitational-wave
      detection. However, we demonstrate how they can still be used to rapidly flag
      the times of potential signals in the data for a more detailed follow-up. Our
      convolutional neural network architecture as well as the proposed performance
      metrics are better suited for this task than a standard binary classifications
      scheme. A detailed evaluation of our approach on Advanced LIGO data demonstrates
      the potential of such systems as trigger generators. Finally, we sound a note
      of caution by constructing adversarial examples, which showcase interesting
      "failure modes" of our model, where inputs with no visible resemblance to real
      gravitational-wave signals are identified as such by the network with high confidence.

    abstract: Modelling is fundamental to many fields of science and engineering.
      A model can be thought of as a representation of possible data one could predict
      from a system. The probabilistic approach to modelling uses probability theory
      to express all aspects of uncertainty in the model. The probabilistic approach
      is synonymous with Bayesian modelling, which simply uses the rules of probability
      theory in order to make predictions, compare alternative models, and learn model
      parameters and structure from data. This simple and elegant framework is most
      powerful when coupled with flexible probabilistic models. Flexibility is achieved
      through the use of Bayesian nonparametrics. This article provides an overview
      of probabilistic modelling and an accessible survey of some of the main tools
      in Bayesian nonparametrics. The survey covers the use of Bayesian nonparametrics
      for modelling unknown functions, density estimation, clustering, time series
      modelling, and representing sparsity, hierarchies, and covariance structure.
      More specifically it gives brief non-technical overviews of Gaussian processes,
      Dirichlet processes, infinite hidden Markov models, Indian buffet processes,
      Kingman's coalescent, Dirichlet diffusion tress, and Wishart processes.

      a framework for understanding what learning is, and has therefore emerged as
      one of the principal theoretical and practical approaches for designing machines
      that learn from data acquired through experience. The probabilistic framework,
      which describes how to represent and manipulate uncertainty about models and
      predictions, has a central role in scientific data analysis, machine learning,
      robotics, cognitive science and artificial intelligence. This Review provides
      an introduction to this framework, and discusses some of the state-of-the-art

    abstract: We present an algorithm that infers the model structure of a mixture
      of factor analysers using an efficient and deterministic variational approximation
      to full Bayesian integration over model parameters. This procedure can automatically
      determine the optimal number of components and the local dimensionality of each
      component (i.e. the number of factors in each factor analyser). Alternatively
      it can be used to infer posterior distributions over number of components and
      dimensionalities. Since all parameters are integrated out the method is not
      prone to overfitting. Using a stochastic procedure for adding components it
      is possible to perform the variational optimisation incrementally and to avoid
      local maxima. Results show that the method works very well in practice and correctly
      infers the number and dimensionality of nontrivial synthetic examples. By importance
      sampling from the variational approximation we show how to obtain unbiased estimates
      of the true evidence, the exact predictive density, and the KL divergence between
      the variational posterior and the true posterior, not only in this model but
      for variational approximations in general.

    abstract: We describe a flexible nonparametric approach to latent variable modelling
      in which the number of latent variables is unbounded. This approach is based
      on a probability distribution over equivalence classes of binary matrices with
      a finite number of rows, corresponding to the data points, and an unbounded
      number of columns, corresponding to the latent variables. Each data point can
      be associated with a subset of the possible latent variables, which we refer
      to as the latent features of that data point. The binary variables in the matrix
      indicate which latent feature is possessed by which data point, and there is
      a potentially infinite array of features. We derive the distribution over unbounded
      binary matrices by taking the limit of a distribution over N   times;K binary
      matrices as K   rarr;   infin;. We define a simple generative processes for
      this distribution which we call the Indian buffet process (IBP; Griffiths and
      Ghahramani, 2005, <a href="/pub/#GriGha06">2006</a>) by analogy to the Chinese
      restaurant process (Aldous, 1985; Pitman, 2002). The IBP has a single hyperparameter
      which controls both the number of feature per ob ject and the total number of
      features. We describe a two-parameter generalization of the IBP which has additional
      flexibility, independently controlling the number of features per object and
      the total number of features in the matrix. The use of this distribution as
      a prior in an infinite latent feature model is illustrated, and Markov chain
      Monte Carlo algorithms for inference are described.

    abstract: 'Inspired by "Google   trade; Sets", we consider the problem of retrieving
      items from a concept or cluster, given a query consisting of a few items from
      that cluster. We formulate this as a Bayesian inference problem and describe
      a very simple algorithm for solving it. Our algorithm uses a model-based concept
      of a cluster and ranks items using a score which evaluates the marginal probability
      that each item belongs to a cluster containing the query items. For exponential
      family models with conjugate priors this marginal probability is a simple function
      of sufficient statistics. We focus on sparse binary data and show that our score
      can be evaluated exactly using a single sparse matrix multiplication, making
      it possible to apply our algorithm to very large datasets. We evaluate our algorithm
      on three datasets: retrieving movies from EachMovie, finding completions of
      author sets from the NIPS dataset, and finding completions of sets of words
      appearing in the Grolier encyclopedia. We compare to Google   trade; Sets and
      show that Bayesian Sets gives very reasonable set completions.'

    abstract: We introduce a new statistical model for time series which iteratively
      segments data into regimes with approximately linear dynamics and learns the
      parameters of each of these linear regimes. This model combines and generalizes
      two of the most widely used stochastic time series models—hidden Markov models
      and linear dynamical systems—and is closely related to models that are widely
      used in the control and econometrics literatures. It can also be derived by
      extending the mixture of experts neural network (Jacobs et al, 1991) to its
      fully dynamical version, in which both expert and gating networks are recurrent.
      Inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden states of this model is
      computationally intractable, and therefore the exact Expectation Maximization
      (EM) algorithm cannot be applied. However, we present a variational approximation
      that maximizes a lower bound on the log likelihood and makes use of both the
      forward–backward recursions for hidden Markov models and the Kalman filter recursions
      for linear dynamical systems. We tested the algorithm both on artificial data
      sets and on a natural data set of respiration force from a patient with sleep
      apnea. The results suggest that variational approximations are a viable method
      for inference and learning in switching state-space models.

    abstract: We first describe a hierarchical, generative model that can be viewed
      as a non-linear generalisation of factor analysis and can be implemented in
      a neural network. The model performs perceptual inference in a probabilistically
      consistent manner by using top-down, bottom-up and lateral connections. These
      connections can be learned using simple rules that require only locally available
      information. We then show how to incorporate lateral connections into the generative
      model. The model extracts a sparse, distributed, hierarchical representation
      of depth from simplified random-dot stereograms and the localised disparity
      detectors in the first hidden layer form a topographic map. When presented with
      image patches from natural scenes, the model develops topographically organised
      local feature detectors.

    abstract: Real-world learning tasks may involve high-dimensional data sets with
      arbitrary patterns of missing data. In this paper we present a framework based
      on maximum likelihood density estimation for learning from such data sets. We
      use mixture models for the density estimates and make two distinct appeals to
      the ExpectationMaximization (EM) principle (Dempster et al., 1977) in deriving
      a learning algorithm—EM is used both for the estimation of mixture components
      and for coping with missing data. The resulting algorithm is applicable to a
      wide range of supervised as well as unsupervised learning problems. Results
      from a classification benchmark—the iris data set—are presented.

    abstract: Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely
      used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM,
      information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable—the
      hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored
      into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed
      manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities
      of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward–backward
      algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due
      to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm
      is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be
      carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational
      framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables
      are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of
      the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient
      and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the
      structured approximation to model Bach's chorales and show that factorial HMMs
      can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM
      cannot.

    abstract: 'A persistent worry with computational models of unsupervised learning
      is that learning will become more difficult as the problem is scaled. We examine
      this issue in the context of a novel hierarchical, generative model that can
      be viewed as a non-linear generalization of factor analysis and can be implemented
      in a neural network. The model performs perceptual inference in a probabilistically

      We then investigate some of the scaling properties of the algorithm on this
      problem and find that : (1) increasing the image size leads to faster and more
      reliable learning; (2) Increasing the depth of the network from one to two hidden
      layers leads to better representations at the first hidden layer, and (3) Once
      one part of the network has discovered how to represent disparity, it ''supervises''
      other parts of the network, greatly speeding up their learning.'

    abstract: The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is an iterative procedure
      for maximum likelihood parameter estimation from data sets with missing or hidden
      variables. It has been applied to system identification in linear stochastic
      state-space models, where the state variables are hidden from the observer and
      both the state and the parameters of the model have to be estimated simultaneously
      [9]. We present a generalization of the EM algorithm for parameter estimation
      in nonlinear dynamical systems. The “expectation” step makes use of Extended
      Kalman Smoothing to estimate the state, while the “maximization” step re-estimates
      the parameters using these uncertain state estimates. In general, the nonlinear
      maximization step is difficult because it requires integrating out the uncertainty
      in the states. However, if Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) approximators
      are used to model the nonlinearities, the integrals become tractable and the
      maximization step can be solved via systems of linear equations.

    abstract: One of the fundamental properties that both neural networks and the
      central nervous system share is the ability to learn and generalize from examples.
      While this property has been studied extensively in the neural network literature
      it has not been thoroughly explored in human perceptual and motor learning.
      We have chosen a coordinate transformation system—the visuomotor map which transforms
      visual coordinates into motor coordinates—to study the generalization effects
      of learning new input–output pairs. Using a paradigm of computer controlled
      altered visual feedback, we have studied the generalization of the visuomotor
      map subsequent to both local and context-dependent remappings. A local remapping
      of one or two input-output pairs induced a significant global, yet decaying,
      change in the visuomotor map, suggesting a representation for the map composed
      of units with large functional receptive fields. Our study of context-dependent
      remappings indicated that a single point in visual space can be mapped to two
      different finger locations depending on a context variable—the starting point
      of the movement. Furthermore, as the context is varied there is a gradual shift
      between the two remappings, consistent with two visuomotor modules being learned
      and gated smoothly with the context.

      on the M25 motorway record speed and flow measurements at regularly spaced locations
      as well as the entry and exit lanes of junctions. An exploratory study of these
      data helps us to better understand and quantify the nature of congestion on
      the road network. From a traveller's perspective it is crucially important to
      understand the overall journey times and we look at methods to improve our ability
      to predict journey times given access jointly to both real-time and historical
      loop detector data. Throughout this paper we will comment on related work derived
      from US freeway data.

    abstract: Exact Gaussian Process (GP) regression has O(N<sup>3</sup>) runtime
      for data size N, making it intractable for large N. Many algorithms for improving
      GP scaling approximate the covariance with lower rank matrices. Other work has
      exploited structure inherent in particular covariance functions, including GPs
      with implied Markov structure, and equispaced inputs (both enable O(N) runtime).
      However, these GP advances have not been extended to the multidimensional input
      setting, despite the preponderance of multidimensional applications. This paper
      introduces and tests novel extensions of structured GPs to multidimensional
      inputs. We present new methods for additive GPs, showing a novel connection
      between the classic backﬁtting method and the Bayesian framework. To achieve
      optimal accuracy-complexity tradeoff, we extend this model with a novel variant
      of projection pursuit regression. Our primary result – projection pursuit Gaussian
      Process Regression – shows orders of magnitude speedup while preserving high
      accuracy. The natural second and third steps include non-Gaussian observations
      and higher dimensional equispaced grid methods. We introduce novel techniques
      to address both of these necessary directions. We thoroughly illustrate the
      power of these three advances on several datasets, achieving close performance
      to the naive Full GP at orders of magnitude less cost.

    abstract: We consider the problem of multi-step ahead prediction in time series
      analysis using the non-parametric Gaussian process model. k-step ahead forecasting
      of a discrete-time non-linear dynamic system can be performed by doing repeated
      one-step ahead predictions. For a state-space model of the form y<sub>t</sub>
      = f(y<sub>t-1</sub>,...,y<sub>t-L</sub>), the prediction of y at time t + k
      is based on the point estimates of the previous outputs. In this paper, we show
      how, using an analytical Gaussian approximation, we can formally incorporate
      the uncertainty about intermediate regressor values, thus updating the uncertainty

    abstract: Telomeres are lengths of repetitive DNA that cap the ends of chromosomes.
      They protect the ends of the chromosome and shorten with each cell division.
      Short leukocyte telomere length has been related to a number of age-related
      diseases. In addition, shorter telomere length has been associated with environmental
      factors such as smoking and lack of exercise. In a recent issue of Biological
      Psychiatry, Tyrka et al. (4) published a report suggesting a link between maltreatment
      in childhood and telomere shortening in 31 subjects. Individuals who had suffered
      maltreatment had telomere length .70 +/- .24 compared with 1.02 +/- .52 in individuals
      who had not been abused.

    abstract: 'Elimination by aspects (EBA) is a probabilistic choice model describing
      how humans decide between several options. The options from which the choice
      is made are characterized by binary features and associated weights. For instance,
      when choosing which mobile phone to buy the features to consider may be: long
      lasting battery, color screen, etc. Existing methods for inferring the parameters
      of the model assume pre-specified features. However, the features that lead
      to the observed choices are not always known. Here, we present a non-parametric
      Bayesian model to infer the features of the options and the corresponding weights
      from choice data. We use the Indian buffet process (IBP) as a prior over the
      features. Inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in conjugate IBP models
      has been previously described. The main contribution of this paper is an MCMC
      algorithm for the EBA model that can also be used in inference for other non-conjugate
      IBP models—this may broaden the use of IBP priors considerably.'

    abstract: In the Bayesian mixture modeling framework it is possible to infer the
      necessary number of components to model the data and therefore it is unnecessary
      to explicitly restrict the number of components. Nonparametric mixture models
      sidestep the problem of finding the "correct" number of mixture components by
      assuming infinitely many components. In this paper Dirichlet process mixture
      (DPM) models are cast as infinite mixture models and inference using Markov
      chain Monte Carlo is described. The specification of the priors on the model
      parameters is often guided by mathematical and practical convenience. The primary
      goal of this paper is to compare the choice of conjugate and non-conjugate base
      distributions on a particular class of DPM models which is widely used in applications,
      the Dirichlet process Gaussian mixture model (DPGMM). We compare computational
      efficiency and modeling performance of DPGMM defined using a conjugate and a
      conditionally conjugate base distribution. We show that better density models
      can result from using a wider class of priors with no or only a modest increase
      in computational effort.

    abstract: Identifying the action potentials of individual neurons from extracellular
      recordings, known as spike sorting, is a challenging problem. We consider the
      spike sorting problem using a generative model,mixtures of factor analysers,
      which concurrently performs clustering and feature extraction. The most important
      advantage of this method is that it quantifies the certainty with which the
      spikes are classified. This can be used as a means for evaluating the quality
      of clustering and therefore spike isolation. Using this method, nearly simultaneously
      occurring spikes can also be modelled which is a hard task for many of the spike
      sorting methods. Furthermore, modelling the data with a generative model allows
      us to generate simulated data.

    abstract: We report on the University of Wisconsin, Madison's experience in the
      TREC Genomics 2006 track, which asks participants to retrieve passages from
      scientific articles that satisfy biologists' information needs. An emphasis
      is placed on returning relevant passages that discuss different aspects of the
      topic. Using an off-the-shelf information retrieval (IR) engine, we focused
      on query generation and reranking query results to encourage relevance and diversity.
      For query generation, we automatically identify noun phrases from the topic
      descriptions, and use online resources to gather synonyms as expansion terms.
      Our first submission uses the baseline IR engine results. We rerank the passages
      using a naive clustering-based approach in our second run, and we test GRASSHOPPER,
      a novel graph-theoretic algorithm based on absorbing random walks, in our third
      run. While our aspect-level results appear to compare favorably with other participants
      on average, our query generation techniques failed to produce adequate query
      results for several topics, causing our passage and document-level evaluation
      scores to suffer. Furthermore, we surprisingly achieved higher aspect-level
      scores using the initial ranking than our methods aimed specifically at promoting
      diversity. While this sounds discouraging, we have several ideas as to why this
      happened and hope to produce new methods that correct these shortcomings.

    abstract: The excellent real-world performance of deep neural networks has received
      increasing attention. Despite the capacity to overfit significantly, such large
      models work better than smaller ones. This phenomenon is often referred to as
      the scaling law by practitioners. It is of fundamental interest to study why
      the scaling law exists and how it avoids/controls overfitting. One approach
      has been looking at infinite width limits of neural networks (e.g., Neural Tangent
      Kernels, Gaussian Processes); however, in practise, these do not fully explain
      finite networks as their infinite counterparts do not learn features. Furthermore,
      the empirical kernel for finite networks (i.e., the inner product of feature
      vectors), changes significantly during training in contrast to infinite width
      networks. In this work we derive an iterative linearised training method. We
      justify iterative lineralisation as an interpolation between finite analogs
      of the infinite width regime, which do not learn features, and standard gradient
      descent training which does. We show some preliminary results where iterative
      linearised training works well, noting in particular how much feature learning
      is required to achieve comparable performance. We also provide novel insights
      into the training behaviour of neural networks.

      learning. Specifically: 1) We develop ML-PIP, a general framework for Meta-Learning
      approximate Probabilistic Inference for Prediction. ML-PIP extends existing
      probabilistic interpretations of meta-learning to cover a broad class of methods.
      2) We introduce , an instance of the framework employing a flexible and versatile

      numbers of shots, and outputs a distribution over task-specific parameters in
      a single forward pass. Versa substitutes optimization at test time with forward
      passes through inference networks, amortizing the cost of inference and relieving
      the need for second derivatives during training. 3) We evaluate  on benchmark
      datasets where the method sets new state-of-the-art results, and can handle
      arbitrary number of shots, and for classification, arbitrary numbers of classes

    abstract: We introduce the Convolutional Conditional Neural Process (ConvCNP),
      a new member of the Neural Process family that models translation equivariance
      in the data. Translation equivariance is an important inductive bias for many
      learning problems including time series modelling, spatial data, and images.
      The model embeds data sets into an infinite-dimensional function space, as opposed
      to finite-dimensional vector spaces. To formalize this notion, we extend the
      theory of neural representations of sets to include functional representations,
      and demonstrate that any translation-equivariant embedding can be represented
      using a convolutional deep-set. We evaluate ConvCNPs in several settings, demonstrating
      that they achieve state-of-the-art performance compared to existing NPs. We
      demonstrate that building in translation equivariance enables zero-shot generalization
      to challenging, out-of-domain tasks.

    abstract: Independent component analysis provides a principled framework for unsupervised
      representation learning, with solid theory on the identifiability of the latent
      code that generated the data, given only observations of mixtures thereof. Unfortunately,
      when the mixing is nonlinear, the model is provably nonidentifiable, since statistical
      independence alone does not sufficiently constrain the problem. Identifiability
      can be recovered in settings where additional, typically observed variables
      are included in the generative process. We investigate an alternative path and
      consider instead including assumptions reflecting the principle of independent
      causal mechanisms exploited in the field of causality. Specifically, our approach
      is motivated by thinking of each source as independently influencing the mixing
      process. This gives rise to a framework which we term independent mechanism
      analysis. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that our approach circumvents
      a number of nonidentifiability issues arising in nonlinear blind source separation.

    abstract: As algorithms are increasingly used to make important decisions that
      affect human lives, ranging from social benefit assignment to predicting risk
      of criminal recidivism, concerns have been raised about the fairness of algorithmic
      decision making. Most prior works on algorithmic fairness normatively prescribe
      how fair decisions ought to be made. In contrast, here, we descriptively survey
      users for how they perceive and reason about fairness in algorithmic decision
      making. A key contribution of this work is the framework we propose to understand
      why people perceive certain features as fair or unfair to be used in algorithms.
      Our framework identifies eight properties of features, such as relevance, volitionality
      and reliability, as latent considerations that inform people’s moral judgments
      about the fairness of feature use in decision-making algorithms. We validate
      our framework through a series of scenario-based surveys with 576 people. We
      find that, based on a person’s assessment of the eight latent properties of
      a feature in our exemplar scenario, we can accurately (> 85

    abstract: 'With wide-spread usage of machine learning methods in numerous domains
      involving human subjects, several studies have raised questions about the potential
      for unfairness towards certain individuals or groups. A number of recent works
      have proposed methods to measure and eliminate unfairness from machine learning
      methods. However, most of this work on fair learning has focused on only one
      dimension of fair decision making: distributive fairness, i.e., the fairness
      of the decision outcomes. In this work, we leverage the rich literature on organizational
      justice and focus on another dimension of fair decision making: procedural fairness,
      i.e., the fairness of the decision making process. We propose measures for procedural
      fairness that consider the input features used in the decision process, and
      evaluate the moral judgments of humans regarding the use of these features.
      We operationalize these measures on two real world datasets using human surveys
      on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT) platform, demonstrating that we capture
      important properties of procedurally fair decision making. We provide fast submodular
      mechanisms to optimize the tradeoff between procedural fairness and prediction
      accuracy. On our datasets, we observe empirically that procedural fairness may
      be achieved with little cost to outcome fairness, but that some loss of accuracy
      is unavoidable.'

    abstract: 'Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle filtering, is a popular class
      of methods for sampling from an intractable target distribution using a sequence
      of simpler intermediate distributions. Like other importance sampling-based
      methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a
      bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution.
      This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using
      an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior
      and the proposal distribution. The method is very flexible, applicable to any
      parameterised proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants.
      We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich
      parameterisations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential
      Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC significantly improves
      inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal
      methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments
      also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning
      when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings.
      Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a neural network-based deep recurrent
      generative model achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for
      polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive
      SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference.'

    abstract: The prediction of time-changing variances is an important task in the
      modeling of financial data. Standard econometric models are often limited as
      they assume rigid functional relationships for the evolution of the variance.
      Moreover, functional parameters are usually learned by maximum likelihood, which
      can lead to overfitting. To address these problems we introduce GP-Vol, a novel
      non-parametric model for time-changing variances based on Gaussian Processes.
      This new model can capture highly flexible functional relationships for the
      variances. Furthermore, we introduce a new online algorithm for fast inference
      in GP-Vol. This method is much faster than current offline inference procedures
      and it avoids overfitting problems by following a fully Bayesian approach. Experiments
      with financial data show that GP-Vol performs significantly better than current
      standard alternatives.

    abstract: Reinforcement learning holds the promise of enabling autonomous robots
      to learn large repertoires of behavioral skills with minimal human intervention.
      However, robotic applications of reinforcement learning often compromise the
      autonomy of the learning process in favor of achieving training times that are
      practical for real physical systems. This typically involves introducing hand-engineered
      policy representations and human-supplied demonstrations. Deep reinforcement
      learning alleviates this limitation by training general-purpose neural network
      policies, but applications of direct deep reinforcement learning algorithms
      have so far been restricted to simulated settings and relatively simple tasks,
      due to their apparent high sample complexity. In this paper, we demonstrate
      that a recent deep reinforcement learning algorithm based on off-policy training
      of deep Q-functions can scale to complex 3D manipulation tasks and can learn
      deep neural network policies efficiently enough to train on real physical robots.
      We demonstrate that the training times can be further reduced by parallelizing
      the algorithm across multiple robots which pool their policy updates asynchronously.
      Our experimental evaluation shows that our method can learn a variety of 3D
      manipulation skills in simulation and a complex door opening skill on real robots
      without any prior demonstrations or manually designed representations.

    abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful parametric models that can be trained
      efficiently using the backpropagation algorithm. Stochastic neural networks
      combine the power of large parametric functions with that of graphical models,
      which makes it possible to learn very complex distributions. However, as backpropagation
      is not directly applicable to stochastic networks that include discrete sampling
      operations within their computational graph, training such networks remains
      difficult. We present MuProp, an unbiased gradient estimator for stochastic
      networks, designed to make this task easier. MuProp improves on the likelihood-ratio
      estimator by reducing its variance using a control variate based on the first-order
      Taylor expansion of a mean-field network. Crucially, unlike prior attempts at
      using backpropagation for training stochastic networks, the resulting estimator
      is unbiased and well behaved. Our experiments on structured output prediction
      and discrete latent variable modeling demonstrate that MuProp yields consistently
      good performance across a range of difficult tasks.

    abstract: Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been successful
      in a wide variety of simulated domains. However, a major obstacle facing deep
      RL in the real world is their high sample complexity. Batch policy gradient
      methods offer stable learning, but at the cost of high variance, which often
      requires large batches. TD-style methods, such as off-policy actor-critic and
      Q-learning, are more sample-efficient but biased, and often require costly hyperparameter
      sweeps to stabilize. In this work, we aim to develop methods that combine the
      stability of policy gradients with the efficiency of off-policy RL. We present
      Q-Prop, a policy gradient method that uses a Taylor expansion of the off-policy
      critic as a control variate. Q-Prop is both sample efficient and stable, and
      effectively combines the benefits of on-policy and off-policy methods. We analyze
      the connection between Q-Prop and existing model-free algorithms, and use control
      variate theory to derive two variants of Q-Prop with conservative and aggressive
      adaptation. We show that conservative Q-Prop provides substantial gains in sample
      efficiency over trust region policy optimization (TRPO) with generalized advantage
      estimation (GAE), and improves stability over deep deterministic policy gradient
      (DDPG), the state-of-the-art on-policy and off-policy methods, on OpenAI Gym's
      MuJoCo continuous control environments.

    abstract: Off-policy model-free deep reinforcement learning methods using previously
      collected data can improve sample efficiency over on-policy policy gradient
      techniques. On the other hand, on-policy algorithms are often more stable and
      easier to use. This paper examines, both theoretically and empirically, approaches
      to merging on- and off-policy updates for deep reinforcement learning. Theoretical
      results show that off-policy updates with a value function estimator can be
      interpolated with on-policy policy gradient updates whilst still satisfying
      performance bounds. Our analysis uses control variate methods to produce a family
      of policy gradient algorithms, with several recently proposed algorithms being
      special cases of this family. We then provide an empirical comparison of these
      techniques with the remaining algorithmic details fixed, and show how different
      mixing of off-policy gradient estimates with on-policy samples contribute to
      improvements in empirical performance. The final algorithm provides a generalization
      and unification of existing deep policy gradient techniques, has theoretical
      guarantees on the bias introduced by off-policy updates, and improves on the
      state-of-the-art model-free deep RL methods on a number of OpenAI Gym continuous
      control benchmarks.

    abstract: Model-free reinforcement learning has been successfully applied to a
      range of challenging problems, and has recently been extended to handle large
      neural network policies and value functions. However, the sample complexity
      of model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function
      approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this
      paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity
      of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two
      complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First,
      we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized
      adantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy
      gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning
      with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance
      on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency
      of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free
      reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models
      are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning
      on domains where such models are applicable.

    abstract: Most clustering algorithms produce a single clustering solution. Similarly,
      feature selection for clustering tries to find one feature subset where one
      interesting clustering solution resides. However, a single data set may be multi-faceted
      and can be grouped and interpreted in many different ways, especially for high
      dimensional data, where feature selection is typically needed. Moreover, different
      clustering solutions are interesting for different purposes. Instead of committing
      to one clustering solution, in this paper we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric
      Bayesian model that can discover several possible clustering solutions and the
      feature subset views that generated each cluster partitioning simultaneously.
      We provide a variational inference approach to learn the features and clustering
      partitions in each view. Our model allows us not only to learn the multiple
      clusterings and views but also allows us to automatically learn the number of
      views and the number of clusters in each view.

    abstract: The contribution described in this paper is an algorithm for learning
      nonlinear, reference tracking, control policies given no prior knowledge of
      the dynamical system and limited interaction with the system through the learning
      process. Concepts from the field of reinforcement learning, Bayesian statistics
      and classical control have been brought together in the formulation of this
      algorithm which can be viewed as a form indirect self tuning regulator. On the
      task of reference tracking using the inverted pendulum it was shown to yield
      generally improved performance on the best controller derived from the standard
      linear quadratic method using only 30 s of total interaction with the system.
      Finally, the algorithm was shown to work on the double pendulum proving its
      ability to solve nontrivial control tasks.

    abstract: Gaussian processes are gaining increasing popularity among the control
      community, in particular for the modelling of discrete time state space systems.
      However, it has not been clear how to incorporate model information, in the
      form of known state relationships, when using a Gaussian process as a predictive
      model. An obvious example of known prior information is position and velocity
      related states. Incorporation of such information would be beneficial both computationally
      and for faster dynamics learning. This paper introduces a method of achieving
      this, yielding faster dynamics learning and a reduction in computational effort
      from O(Dn<sup>2</sup>) to O((D-F)n<sup>2</sup>) in the prediction stage for
      a system with D states, F known state relationships and n observations. The
      effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through its inclusion in the PILCO
      learning algorithm with application to the swing-up and balance of a torque-limited
      pendulum and the balancing of a robotic unicycle in simulation.

    abstract: 'Inspired by the recent upsurge of interest in Bayesian methods we consider
      adaptive regularization. A generalization based scheme for adaptation of regularization
      parameters is introduced and compared to Bayesian regularization. We show that
      pruning arises naturally within both adaptive regularization schemes. As model
      example we have chosen the simplest possible: estimating the mean of a random
      variable with known variance. Marked similarities are found between the two
      methods in that they both involve a "noise limit", below which they regularize
      with infinite weight decay, i.e., they prune. However, pruning is not always
      beneficial. We show explicitly that both methods in some cases may increase
      the generalization error. This corresponds to situations where the underlying
      assumptions of the regularizer are poorly matched to the environment.'

    abstract: Current Bayesian models for dynamic social network data have focused
      on modelling the influence of evolving unobserved structure on observed social
      interactions. However, an understanding of how observed social relationships
      from the past affect future unobserved structure in the network has been neglected.
      In this paper, we introduce a new probabilistic model for capturing this phenomenon,
      which we call latent feature propagation, in social networks. We demonstrate
      our model's capability for inferring such latent structure in varying types
      of social network datasets, and experimental studies show this structure achieves
      higher predictive performance on link prediction and forecasting tasks.

    abstract: We define the beta diffusion tree, a random tree structure with a set

      analogously to the Dirichlet and Pitman–Yor diffusion trees (Neal, 2003b; Knowles     Ghahramani,
      2011), both of which define tree structures over clusters of the particles.
      With the beta diffusion tree, however, multiple copies of a particle may exist
      and diffuse to multiple locations in the continuous space, resulting in (a random
      number of) possibly overlapping clusters of the objects. We demonstrate how
      to build a hierarchically-clustered factor analysis model with the beta diffusion
      tree and how to perform inference over the random tree structures with a Markov

      sequences of negative binomial processes with a common beta process base measure.
      In Bayesian nonparametric applications, such processes have served as models
      for unknown multisets of a measurable space. Previous work has characterized
      random subsets arising from conditionally-i.i.d. sequences of Bernoulli processes
      with a common beta process base measure. In this case, the combinatorial structure
      is described by the Indian buffet process. Our results give a count analogue

      process. As an intermediate step toward this goal, we provide constructions

    abstract: We present a novel algorithm for agglomerative hierarchical clustering
      based on evaluating marginal likelihoods of a probabilistic model. This algorithm
      has several advantages over traditional distance-based agglomerative clustering
      algorithms. (1) It defines a probabilistic model of the data which can be used
      to compute the predictive distribution of a test point and the probability of
      it belonging to any of the existing clusters in the tree. (2) It uses a model-based
      criterion to decide on merging clusters rather than an ad-hoc distance metric.
      (3) Bayesian hypothesis testing is used to decide which merges are advantageous
      and to output the recommended depth of the tree. (4) The algorithm can be interpreted
      as a novel fast bottom-up approximate inference method for a Dirichlet process
      (i.e. countably infinite) mixture model (DPM). It provides a new lower bound
      on the marginal likelihood of a DPM by summing over exponentially many clusterings
      of the data in polynomial time. We describe procedures for learning the model
      hyperpa-rameters, computing the predictive distribution, and extensions to the
      algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world data sets demonstrate
      useful properties of the algorithm.

    abstract: We present a Bayesian framework for content-based image retrieval which
      models the distribution of color and texture features within sets of related
      images. Given a userspecified text query (e.g. "penguins") the system first
      extracts a set of images, from a labelled corpus, corresponding to that query.
      The distribution over features of these images is used to compute a Bayesian
      score for each image in a large unlabelled corpus. Unlabelled images are then
      ranked using this score and the top images are returned. Although the Bayesian
      score is based on computing marginal likelihoods, which integrate over model
      parameters, in the case of sparse binary data the score reduces to a single
      matrix-vector multiplication and is therefore extremely efficient to compute.
      We show that our method works surprisingly well despite its simplicity and the
      fact that no relevance feedback is used. We compare different choices of features,
      and evaluate our results using human subjects.

    abstract: Although clustering data into mutually exclusive partitions has been
      an extremely successful approach to unsupervised learning, there are many situations
      in which a richer model is needed to fully represent the data. This is the case
      in problems where data points actually simultaneously belong to multiple, overlapping
      clusters. For example a particular gene may have several functions, therefore
      belonging to several distinct clusters of genes, and a biologist may want to
      discover these through unsupervised modeling of gene expression data. We present
      a new nonparametric Bayesian method, the Infinite Overlapping Mixture Model
      (IOMM), for modeling overlapping clusters. The IOMM uses exponential family
      distributions to model each cluster and forms an overlapping mixture by taking
      products of such distributions, much like products of experts (Hinton, 2002).
      The IOMM allows an unbounded number of clusters, and assignments of points to
      (multiple) clusters is modeled using an Indian Buffet Process (IBP), (Griffiths
      and Ghahramani, 2006). The IOMM has the desirable properties of being able to
      focus in on overlapping regions while maintaining the ability to model a potentially
      infinite number of clusters which may overlap. We derive MCMC inference algorithms
      for the IOMM and show that these can be used to cluster movies into multiple
      genres.

    abstract: We present a principled Bayesian framework for modeling partial memberships
      of data points to clusters. Unlike a standard mixture model which assumes that
      each data point belongs to one and only one mixture component, or cluster, a
      partial membership model allows data points to have fractional membership in
      multiple clusters. Algorithms which assign data points partial memberships to
      clusters can be useful for tasks such as clustering genes based on microarray
      data (Gasch & Eisen, 2002). Our Bayesian Partial Membership Model (BPM) uses
      exponential family distributions to model each cluster, and a product of these
      distibtutions, with weighted parameters, to model each datapoint. Here the weights
      correspond to the degree to which the datapoint belongs to each cluster. All
      parameters in the BPM are continuous, so we can use Hybrid Monte Carlo to perform
      inference and learning. We discuss relationships between the BPM and Latent
      Dirichlet Allocation, Mixed Membership models, Exponential Family PCA, and fuzzy
      clustering. Lastly, we show some experimental results and discuss nonparametric
      extensions to our model.

    abstract: 'Gaussian process (GP) models form a core part of probabilistic machine
      learning. Considerable research effort has been made into attacking three issues
      with GP models: how to compute efficiently when the number of data is large;
      how to approximate the posterior when the likelihood is not Gaussian and how
      to estimate covariance function parameter posteriors. This paper simultaneously
      addresses these, using a variational approximation to the posterior which is
      sparse in support of the function but otherwise free-form. The result is a Hybrid
      Monte-Carlo sampling scheme which allows for a non-Gaussian approximation over
      the function values and covariance parameters simultaneously, with efficient
      computations based on inducing-point sparse GPs. Code to replicate each experiment
      in this paper will be available shortly.'

    abstract: 'A probabilistic model based on the horseshoe prior is proposed for
      learning de- pendencies in the process of identifying relevant features for
      prediction. Exact inference is intractable in this model. However, expectation
      propagation offers an approximate alternative. Because the process of estimating
      feature selection dependencies may suffer from over-fitting in the model proposed,
      additional data from a multi-task learning scenario are considered for induction.
      The same model can be used in this setting with few modifications. Furthermore,
      the assumptions made are less restrictive than in other multi-task methods:
      The different tasks must share feature selection dependencies, but can have
      different relevant features and model coefficients. Experiments with real and
      synthetic data show that this model performs better than other multi-task alternatives
      from the literature. The experiments also show that the model is able to induce
      suitable feature selection dependencies for the problems considered, only from

    abstract: Multi-class Gaussian Processs Classifiers (MGPCs) are often affected
      by overfitting problems when labeling errors occur far from the decision boundaries.
      To prevent this, we investigate a robust MGPC (RMGPC) which considers labeling
      errors independently of their distance to the decision boundaries. Expectation
      propagation is used for approximate inference. Experiments with several datasets
      in which noise is injected in the labels illustrate the benefits of RMGPC. This
      method performs better than other Gaussian process alternatives based on considering
      latent Gaussian noise or heavy-tailed processes. When no noise is injected in
      the labels, RMGPC still performs equal or better than the other methods. Finally,
      we show how RMGPC can be used for successfully indentifying data instances which
      are difficult to classify correctly in practice.

    abstract: We describe a Bayesian method for group feature selection in linear
      regression problems. The method is based on a generalized version of the standard
      spike-and-slab prior distribution which is often used for individual feature
      selection. Exact Bayesian inference under the prior considered is infeasible
      for typical regression problems. However, approximate inference can be carried
      out efficiently using Expectation Propagation (EP). A detailed analysis of the
      generalized spike-and-slab prior shows that it is well suited for regression
      problems that are sparse at the group level. Furthermore, this prior can be
      used to introduce prior knowledge about specific groups of features that are
      a priori believed to be more relevant. An experimental evaluation compares the
      performance of the proposed method with those of group LASSO, Bayesian group
      LASSO, automatic relevance determination and additional variants used for group
      feature selection. The results of these experiments show that a model based
      on the generalized spike-and-slab prior and the EP algorithm has state-of-the-art
      prediction performance in the problems analyzed. Furthermore, this model is
      also very useful to carry out sequential experimental design (also known as
      active learning), where the data instances that are most informative are iteratively
      included in the training set, reducing the number of instances needed to obtain
      a particular level of prediction accuracy.

    abstract: We propose a novel information-theoretic approach for Bayesian optimization
      called Predictive Entropy Search (PES). At each iteration, PES selects the next
      evaluation point that maximizes the expected information gained with respect
      to the global maximum. PES codifies this intractable acquisition function in
      terms of the expected reduction in the differential entropy of the predictive
      distribution. This reformulation allows PES to obtain approximations that are
      both more accurate and efficient than other alternatives such as Entropy Search
      (ES). Furthermore, PES can easily perform a fully Bayesian treatment of the
      model hyperparameters while ES cannot. We evaluate PES in both synthetic and
      realworld applications, including optimization problems in machine learning,
      finance, biotechnology, and robotics. We show that the increased accuracy of
      PES leads to significant gains in optimization performance.

    abstract: We propose a probabilistic matrix factorization model for collaborative
      filtering that learns from data that is missing not at random (MNAR). Matrix
      factorization models exhibit state-of-the-art predictive performance in collaborative
      filtering. However, these models usually assume that the data is missing at
      random (MAR), and this is rarely the case. For example, the data is not MAR
      if users rate items they like more than ones they dislike. When the MAR assumption
      is incorrect, inferences are biased and predictive performance can suffer. Therefore,
      we model both the generative process for the data and the missing data mechanism.
      By learning these two models jointly we obtain improved performance over state-of-the-art
      methods when predicting the ratings and when modeling the data observation process.
      We present the first viable MF model for MNAR data. Our results are promising
      and we expect that further research on NMAR models will yield large gains in
      collaborative filtering.

    abstract: Black-box alpha (BB-α) is a new approximate inference method based on
      the minimization of α-divergences. BB-α scales to large datasets because it
      can be implemented using stochastic gradient descent. BB-α can be applied to
      complex probabilistic models with little effort since it only requires as input
      the likelihood function and its gradients. These gradients can be easily obtained
      using automatic differentiation. By changing the divergence parameter α, the
      method is able to interpolate between variational Bayes (VB) (α→ 0) and an algorithm
      similar to expectation propagation (EP) (α = 1). Experiments on probit regression
      and neural network regression and classification problems show that BB-αwith
      non-standard settings of α, such as α = 0.5, usually produces better predictions
      than with α→ 0 (VB) or α = 1 (EP).

    abstract: The estimation of dependencies between multiple variables is a central
      problem in the analysis of financial time series. A common approach is to express
      these dependencies in terms of a copula function. Typically the copula function
      is assumed to be constant but this may be inaccurate when there are covariates
      that could have a large influence on the dependence structure of the data. To
      account for this, a Bayesian framework for the estimation of conditional copulas
      is proposed. In this framework the parameters of a copula are non-linearly related
      to some arbitrary conditioning variables. We evaluate the ability of our method
      to predict time-varying dependencies on several equities and currencies and
      observe consistent performance gains compared to static copula models and other
      time-varying copula methods.

    abstract: Unknown constraints arise in many types of expensive black-box optimization
      problems. Several methods have been proposed recently for performing Bayesian
      optimization with constraints, based on the expected improvement (EI) heuristic.
      However, EI can lead to pathologies when used with constraints. For example,
      in the case of decoupled constraints—i.e., when one can independently evaluate
      the objective or the constraints—EI can encounter a pathology that prevents
      exploration. Additionally, computing EI requires a current best solution, which
      may not exist if none of the data collected so far satisfy the constraints.
      By contrast, information-based approaches do not suffer from these failure modes.
      In this paper, we present a new information-based method called Predictive Entropy
      Search with Constraints (PESC). We analyze the performance of PESC and show
      that it compares favorably to EI-based approaches on synthetic and benchmark
      problems, as well as several real-world examples. We demonstrate that PESC is
      an effective algorithm that provides a promising direction towards a unified
      solution for constrained Bayesian optimization.

    abstract: We address the problem of finding the maximizer of a nonlinear function
      that can only be evaluated, subject to noise, at a finite number of query locations.
      Further, we will assume that there is a constraint on the total number of permitted
      function evaluations. We introduce a Bayesian approach for this problem and
      show that it empirically outperforms both the existing frequentist counterpart
      and other Bayesian optimization methods. The Bayesian approach places emphasis
      on detailed modelling, including the modelling of correlations among the arms.
      As a result, it can perform well in situations where the number of arms is much
      larger than the number of allowed function evaluation, whereas the frequentist
      counterpart is inapplicable. This feature enables us to develop and deploy practical
      applications, such as automatic machine learning toolboxes. The paper presents
      comprehensive comparisons of the proposed approach with many Bayesian and bandit
      optimization techniques, the first comparison of many of these methods in the
      literature.

    abstract: Entity linking involves labeling phrases in text with their referent
      entities, such as Wikipedia or Freebase entries. This task is challenging due
      to the large number of possible entities, in the millions, and heavy-tailed
      mention ambiguity. We formulate the problem in terms of probabilistic inference
      within a topic model, where each topic is associated with a Wikipedia article.
      To deal with the large number of topics we propose a novel efficient Gibbs sampling
      scheme which can also incorporate side information, such as the Wikipedia graph.
      This conceptually simple probabilistic approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
      in entity-linking on the Aida-CoNLL dataset.

    abstract: 'We present a new matrix factorization model for rating data and a corresponding
      active learning strategy to address the cold-start problem. Cold-start is one
      of the most challenging tasks for recommender systems: what to recommend with
      new users or items for which one has little or no data. An approach is to use
      active learning to collect the most useful initial ratings. However, the performance
      of active learning depends strongly upon having accurate estimates of i) the
      uncertainty in model parameters and ii) the intrinsic noisiness of the data.
      To achieve these estimates we propose a heteroskedastic Bayesian model for ordinal
      matrix factorization. We also present a computationally efficient framework
      for Bayesian active learning with this type of complex probabilistic model.
      This algorithm successfully distinguishes between informative and noisy data
      points. Our model yields state-of-the-art predictive performance and, coupled
      with our active learning strategy, enables us to gain useful information in
      the cold-start setting from the very first active sample.'

    abstract: We present a new model based on Gaussian processes (GPs) for learning
      pairwise preferences expressed by multiple users. Inference is simplified by
      using a preference kernel for GPs which allows us to combine supervised GP learning
      of user preferences with unsupervised dimensionality reduction for multi-user
      systems. The model not only exploits collaborative information from the shared
      structure in user behavior, but may also incorporate user features if they are
      available. Approximate inference is implemented using a combination of expectation
      propagation and variational Bayes. Finally, we present an efficient active learning
      strategy for querying preferences. The proposed technique performs favorably
      on real-world data against state-of-the-art multi-user preference learning algorithms.

    abstract: Information theoretic active learning has been widely studied for probabilistic
      models. For simple regression an optimal myopic policy is easily tractable.
      However, for other tasks and with more complex models, such as classification
      with nonparametric models, the optimal solution is harder to compute. Current
      approaches make approximations to achieve tractability. We propose an approach
      that expresses information gain in terms of predictive entropies, and apply
      this method to the Gaussian Process Classifier (GPC). Our approach makes minimal
      approximations to the full information theoretic objective. Our experimental
      performance compares favourably to many popular active learning algorithms,
      and has equal or lower computational complexity. We compare well to decision
      theoretic approaches also, which are privy to more information and require much
      more computational time. Secondly, by developing further a reformulation of
      binary preference learning to a classification problem, we extend our algorithm
      to Gaussian Process preference learning.

    abstract: Humans develop rich mental representations that guide their behavior
      in a variety of every-day tasks. However, it is unknown whether these representations,
      often formalized as priors in Bayesian inference, are specific for each task
      or subserve multiple tasks. Current approaches cannot distinguish between these
      two possibilities because they cannot extract comparable representations across
      different tasks. Here, we develop a novel method, termed cognitive tomography,
      that can extract complex, multi-dimensional priors across tasks. We apply this
      method to human judgments in two qualitatively different tasks, familiarity
      and odd-one-out, involving an ecologically relevant set of stimuli, human faces.
      We show that priors over faces are structurally complex and vary dramatically
      across subjects, but are invariant across the tasks within each subject. The
      priors we extract from each task allow us to predict with high precision the
      behavior of subjects for novel stimuli both in the same task as well as in the
      other task. Our results provide the first evidence for a single high-dimensional
      structured representation of a naturalistic stimulus set that guides behavior
      in multiple tasks. Moreover, the representations estimated by cognitive tomography
      can provide independent, behavior-based regressors for elucidating the neural
      correlates of complex naturalistic priors.

    abstract: Recent work has shown that the prior over functions induced by a deep
      Bayesian neural network (BNN) behaves as a Gaussian process (GP) as the width
      of all layers becomes large. However, many BNN applications are concerned with
      the BNN function space posterior. While some empirical evidence of the posterior
      convergence was provided in the original works of Neal (1996) and Matthews et
      al. (2018), it is limited to small datasets or architectures due to the notorious
      difficulty of obtaining and verifying exactness of BNN posterior approximations.
      We provide the missing theoretical proof that the exact BNN posterior converges
      (weakly) to the one induced by the GP limit of the prior. For empirical validation,
      we show how to generate exact samples from a finite BNN on a small dataset via
      rejection sampling.

    abstract: There is a growing amount of literature on the relationship between
      wide neural networks (NNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs), identifying an equivalence
      between the two for a variety of NN architectures. This equivalence enables,
      for instance, accurate approximation of the behaviour of wide Bayesian NNs without
      MCMC or variational approximations, or characterisation of the distribution
      of randomly initialised wide NNs optimised by gradient descent without ever
      running an optimiser. We provide a rigorous extension of these results to NNs
      involving attention layers, showing that unlike single-head attention, which
      induces non-Gaussian behaviour, multi-head attention architectures behave as
      GPs as the number of heads tends to infinity. We further discuss the effects
      of positional encodings and layer normalisation, and propose modifications of
      the attention mechanism which lead to improved results for both finite and infinitely
      wide NNs. We evaluate attention kernels empirically, leading to a moderate improvement
      upon the previous state-of-the-art on CIFAR-10 for GPs without trainable kernels
      and advanced data preprocessing. Finally, we introduce new features to the Neural
      Tangents library (Novak et al., 2020) allowing applications of NNGP/NTK models,
      with and without attention, to variable-length sequences, with an example on
      the IMDb reviews dataset.

    abstract: 'Two-stage recommender systems are widely adopted in industry due to
      their scalability and maintainability. These systems produce recommendations
      in two steps: (i) multiple nominators preselect a small number of items from
      a large pool using cheap-to-compute item embeddings; (ii) with a richer set
      of features, a ranker rearranges the nominated items and serves them to the
      user. A key challenge of this setup is that optimal performance of each stage
      in isolation does not imply optimal global performance. In response to this
      issue, Ma et al. (2020) proposed a nominator training objective importance weighted
      by the ranker''s probability of recommending each item. In this work, we focus
      on the complementary issue of exploration. Modeled as a contextual bandit problem,
      we find LinUCB (a near optimal exploration strategy for single-stage systems)
      may lead to linear regret when deployed in two-stage recommenders. We therefore
      propose a method of synchronising the exploration strategies between the ranker
      and the nominators. Our algorithm only relies on quantities already computed
      by standard LinUCB at each stage and can be implemented in three lines of additional
      code. We end by demonstrating the effectiveness of our algorithm experimentally.'

    abstract: 'Thanks to their scalability, two-stage recommenders are used by many
      of today''s largest online platforms, including YouTube, LinkedIn, and Pinterest.
      These systems produce recommendations in two steps: (i) multiple nominators,
      tuned for low prediction latency, preselect a small subset of candidates from
      the whole item pool; (ii) a slower but more accurate ranker further narrows
      down the nominated items, and serves to the user. Despite their popularity,
      the literature on two-stage recommenders is relatively scarce, and the algorithms
      are often treated as mere sums of their parts. Such treatment presupposes that
      the two-stage performance is explained by the behavior of the individual components
      in isolation. This is not the case: using synthetic and real-world data, we
      demonstrate that interactions between the ranker and the nominators substantially
      affect the overall performance. Motivated by these findings, we derive a generalization
      lower bound which shows that independent nominator training can lead to performance
      on par with uniformly random recommendations. We find that careful design of
      item pools, each assigned to a different nominator, alleviates these issues.
      As manual search for a good pool allocation is difficult, we propose to learn
      one instead using a Mixture-of-Experts based approach. This significantly improves
      both precision and recall at K.'

    abstract: Content creators compete for user attention. Their reach crucially depends
      on algorithmic choices made by developers on online platforms. To maximize exposure,
      many creators adapt strategically, as evidenced by examples like the sprawling
      search engine optimization industry. This begets competition for the finite
      user attention pool. We formalize these dynamics in what we call an exposure
      game, a model of incentives induced by algorithms including modern factorization
      and (deep) two-tower architectures. We prove that seemingly innocuous algorithmic
      choices—e.g., non-negative vs. unconstrained factorization—significantly affect
      the existence and character of (Nash) equilibria in exposure games. We proffer
      use of creator behavior models like ours for an (ex-ante) pre-deployment audit.
      Such an audit can identify misalignment between desirable and incentivized content,
      and thus complement post-hoc measures like content filtering and moderation.
      To this end, we propose tools for numerically finding equilibria in exposure
      games, and illustrate results of an audit on the MovieLens and LastFM datasets.
      Among else, we find that the strategically produced content exhibits strong
      dependence between algorithmic exploration and content diversity, and between
      model expressivity and bias towards gender-based user and creator groups.

    abstract: Dropout, a stochastic regularisation technique for training of neural
      networks, has recently been reinterpreted as a specific type of approximate
      inference algorithm for Bayesian neural networks. The main contribution of the
      reinterpretation is in providing a theoretical framework useful for analysing
      and extending the algorithm. We show that the proposed framework suffers from
      several issues; from undefined or pathological behaviour of the true posterior
      related to use of improper priors, to an ill-defined variational objective due
      to singularity of the approximating distribution relative to the true posterior.
      Our analysis of the improper log uniform prior used in variational Gaussian
      dropout suggests the pathologies are generally irredeemable, and that the algorithm
      still works only because the variational formulation annuls some of the pathologies.
      To address the singularity issue, we proffer Quasi-KL (QKL) divergence, a new
      approximate inference objective for approximation of high-dimensional distributions.
      We show that motivations for variational Bernoulli dropout based on discretisation
      and noise have QKL as a limit. Properties of QKL are studied both theoretically
      and on a simple practical example which shows that the QKL-optimal approximation
      of a full rank Gaussian with a degenerate one naturally leads to the Principal
      Component Analysis solution.

    abstract: We introduce repriorisation, a data-dependent reparameterisation which
      transforms a Bayesian neural network (BNN) posterior to a distribution whose
      KL divergence to the BNN prior vanishes as layer widths grow. The repriorisation
      map acts directly on parameters, and its analytic simplicity complements the
      known neural network Gaussian process (NNGP) behaviour of wide BNNs in function
      space. Exploiting the repriorisation, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo
      (MCMC) posterior sampling algorithm which mixes faster the wider the BNN. This
      contrasts with the typically poor performance of MCMC in high dimensions. We
      observe up to 50x higher effective sample size relative to no reparametrisation
      for both fully-connected and residual networks. Improvements are achieved at
      all widths, with the margin between reparametrised and standard BNNs growing
      with layer width.

    abstract: Herding and kernel herding are deterministic methods of choosing samples
      which summarise a probability distribution. A related task is choosing samples
      for estimating integrals using Bayesian quadrature. We show that the criterion
      minimised when selecting samples in kernel herding is equivalent to the posterior
      variance in Bayesian quadrature. We then show that sequential Bayesian quadrature
      can be viewed as a weighted version of kernel herding which achieves performance
      superior to any other weighted herding method. We demonstrate empirically a
      rate of convergence faster than O(1/N). Our results also imply an upper bound
      on the empirical error of the Bayesian quadrature estimate.

    abstract: Inference in popular nonparametric Bayesian models typically relies
      on sampling or other approximations. This paper presents a general methodology
      for constructing novel tractable nonparametric Bayesian methods by applying
      the kernel trick to inference in a parametric Bayesian model. For example, Gaussian
      process regression can be derived this way from Bayesian linear regression.
      Despite the success of the Gaussian process framework, the kernel trick is rarely
      explicitly considered in the Bayesian literature. In this paper, we aim to fill
      this gap and demonstrate the potential of applying the kernel trick to tractable
      Bayesian parametric models in a wider context than just regression. As an example,
      we present an intuitive Bayesian kernel machine for density estimation that
      is obtained by applying the kernel trick to a Gaussian generative model in feature
      space.

    abstract: A central challenge in cognitive science is to measure and quantify
      the mental representations humans develop — in other words, to 'read' subject's
      minds. In order to eliminate potential biases in reporting mental contents due
      to verbal elaboration, subjects' responses in experiments are often limited
      to binary decisions or discrete choices that do not require conscious reflection
      upon their mental contents. However, it is unclear what such impoverished data
      can tell us about the potential richness and dynamics of subjects' mental representations.
      To address this problem, we used ideal observer models that formalise choice
      behaviour as (quasi-)Bayes-optimal, given subjects' representations in long-term
      memory, acquired through prior learning, and the stimuli currently available
      to them. Bayesian inversion of such ideal observer models allowed us to infer
      subjects' mental representation from their choice behaviour in a variety of
      psychophysical tasks. The inferred mental representations also allowed us to
      predict future choices of subjects with reasonable accuracy, even in tasks that
      were different from those in which the representations were estimated. These
      results demonstrate a significant potential in standard binary decision tasks
      to recover detailed information about subjects' mental representations

    abstract: 'Dynamical systems are a powerful formalism to analyse the world around
      us. Many datasets are sequential in nature, and can be described by a discrete
      time evolution law. We are interested in approaching the analysis of such datasets
      from a probabilistic perspective. We would like to maintain justified beliefs
      about quantities which, though useful in explaining the behaviour of a system,
      may not be observable, as well as about the system''s evolution itself, especially
      in regimes we have not yet observed in our data. The framework of statistical
      inference gives us the tools to do so, yet, for many systems of interest, performing
      inference exactly is not computationally or analytically tractable. The contribution
      of this thesis, then, is twofold: first, we uncover two sources of bias in existing
      variational inference methods applied to dynamical systems in general, and state
      space models whose transition function is drawn from a Gaussian process (GPSSM)
      in particular. We show bias can derive from assuming posteriors in non-linear
      systems to be jointly Gaussian, and from assuming that we can sever the dependence
      between latent states and transition function in state space model posteriors.
      Second, we propose methods to address these issues, undoing the resulting biases.
      We do this without compromising on computational efficiency or on the ability
      to scale to larger datasets and higher dimensions, compared to the methods we
      rectify. One method, the Markov Autoregressive Flow (Markov AF) addresses the
      Gaussian assumption, by providing a more flexible class of posteriors, based
      on normalizing flows, which can be easily evaluated, sampled, and optimised.
      The other method, Variationally Coupled Dynamics and Trajectories (VCDT), tackles
      the factorisation assumption, leveraging sparse Gaussian processes and their
      variational representation to reintroduce dependence between latent states and
      the transition function at no extra computational cost. Since the objective
      of inference is to maintain calibrated beliefs, if we employed approximations
      which are significantly biased in non-linear, noisy systems, or when there is
      little data available, we would have failed in our objective, as those are precisely
      the regimes in which uncertainty quantification is all the more important. Hence
      we think it is essential, if we wish to act optimally on such beliefs, to uncover,
      and, if possible, to correct, all sources of systematic bias in our inference
      methods.'

    abstract: We focus on variational inference in dynamical systems where the discrete
      time transition function (or evolution rule) is modelled by a Gaussian process.
      The dominant approach so far has been to use a factorised posterior distribution,
      decoupling the transition function from the system states. This is not exact
      in general and can lead to an overconfident posterior over the transition function
      as well as an overestimation of the intrinsic stochasticity of the system (process
      noise). We propose a new method that addresses these issues and incurs no additional
      computational costs.

    abstract: 'We identify a new variational inference scheme for dynamical systems
      whose transition function is modelled by a Gaussian process. Inference in this
      setting has either employed computationally intensive MCMC methods, or relied
      on factorisations of the variational posterior. As we demonstrate in our experiments,
      the factorisation between latent system states and transition function can lead
      to a miscalibrated posterior and to learning unnecessarily large noise terms.
      We eliminate this factorisation by explicitly modelling the dependence between
      state trajectories and the Gaussian process posterior. Samples of the latent
      states can then be tractably generated by conditioning on this representation.
      The method we obtain (VCDT: variationally coupled dynamics and trajectories)
      gives better predictive performance and more calibrated estimates of the transition
      function, yet maintains the same time and space complexities as mean-field methods.

    abstract: A mixture of Gaussians fit to a single curved or heavy-tailed cluster
      will report that the data contains many clusters. To produce more appropriate
      clusterings, we introduce a model which warps a latent mixture of Gaussians
      to produce nonparametric cluster shapes. The possibly low-dimensional latent
      mixture model allows us to summarize the properties of the high-dimensional
      clusters (or density manifolds) describing the data. The number of manifolds,
      as well as the shape and dimension of each manifold is automatically inferred.
      We derive a simple inference scheme for this model which analytically integrates
      out both the mixture parameters and the warping function. We show that our model
      is effective for density estimation, performs better than infinite Gaussian
      mixture models at recovering the true number of clusters, and produces interpretable
      summaries of high-dimensional datasets.

    abstract: Many automatic visualization methods have been proposed. However, a
      visualization that is automatically generated might be different to how a user
      wants to arrange the objects in visualization space. By allowing users to re-locate
      objects in the embedding space of the visualization, they can adjust the visualization
      to their preference. We propose an active learning framework for interactive
      visualization which selects objects for the user to re-locate so that they can
      obtain their desired visualization by re-locating as few as possible. The framework
      is based on an information theoretic criterion, which favors objects that reduce
      the uncertainty of the visualization. We present a concrete application of the
      proposed framework to the Laplacian eigenmap visualization method. We demonstrate
      experimentally that the proposed framework yields the desired visualization
      with fewer user interactions than existing methods.

    abstract: We propose a method for unsupervised many-to-many object matching from
      multiple networks, which is the task of finding correspondences between groups
      of nodes in different networks. For example, the proposed method can discover
      shared word groups from multi-lingual document-word networks without cross-language
      alignment information. We assume that multiple networks share groups, and each
      group has its own interaction pattern with other groups. Using infinite relational
      models with this assumption, objects in different networks are clustered into
      common groups depending on their interaction patterns, discovering a matching.
      The effectiveness of the proposed method is experimentally demonstrated by using
      synthetic and real relational data sets, which include applications to cross-domain
      recommendation without shared user/item identifiers and multi-lingual word clustering.

    abstract: Many people share their activities with others through online communities.
      These shared activities have an impact on other users' activities. For example,
      users are likely to become interested in items that are adopted (e.g. liked,
      bought and shared) by their friends. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic
      model for discovering latent influence from sequences of item adoption events.
      An inhomogeneous Poisson process is used for modeling a sequence, in which adoption
      by a user triggers the subsequent adoption of the same item by other users.
      For modeling adoption of multiple items, we employ multiple inhomogeneous Poisson
      processes, which share parameters, such as influence for each user and relations
      between users. The proposed model can be used for finding influential users,
      discovering relations between users and predicting item popularity in the future.
      We present an efficient Bayesian inference procedure of the proposed model based
      on the stochastic EM algorithm. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated
      by using real data sets in a social bookmark sharing service.

    abstract: Categorical variables are a natural choice for representing discrete
      structure in the world. However, stochastic neural networks rarely use categorical
      latent variables due to the inability to backpropagate through samples. In this
      work, we present an efficient gradient estimator that replaces the non-differentiable
      sample from a categorical distribution with a differentiable sample from a novel
      Gumbel-Softmax distribution. This distribution has the essential property that
      it can be smoothly annealed into a categorical distribution. We show that our
      Gumbel-Softmax estimator outperforms state-of-the-art gradient estimators on
      structured output prediction and unsupervised generative modeling tasks with
      categorical latent variables, and enables large speedups on semi-supervised
      classification.

    abstract: Posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL) is an effective
      method for balancing exploration and exploitation in reinforcement learning.
      Randomised value functions (RVF) can be viewed as a promising approach to scaling
      PSRL. However, we show that most contemporary algorithms combining RVF with
      neural network function approximation do not possess the properties which make
      PSRL effective, and provably fail in sparse reward problems. Moreover, we find
      that propagation of uncertainty, a property of PSRL previously thought important
      for exploration, does not preclude this failure. We use these insights to design
      Successor Uncertainties (SU), a cheap and easy to implement RVF algorithm that
      retains key properties of PSRL. SU is highly effective on hard tabular exploration
      benchmarks. Furthermore, on the Atari 2600 domain, it surpasses human performance
      on 38 of 49 games tested (achieving a median human normalised score of 2.09),
      and outperforms its closest RVF competitor, Bootstrapped DQN, on 36 of those.

    abstract: This paper proposes a general method for improving the structure and
      quality of sequences generated by a recurrent neural network (RNN), while maintaining
      information originally learned from data, as well as sample diversity. An RNN
      is first pre-trained on data using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), and
      the probability distribution over the next token in the sequence learned by
      this model is treated as a prior policy. Another RNN is then trained using reinforcement
      learning (RL) to generate higher-quality outputs that account for domain-specific
      incentives while retaining proximity to the prior policy of the MLE RNN. To
      formalize this objective, we derive novel off-policy RL methods for RNNs from
      KL-control. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two applications;
      1) generating novel musical melodies, and 2) computational molecular generation.
      For both problems, we show that the proposed method improves the desired properties
      and structure of the generated sequences, while maintaining information learned
      from data.

    abstract: Conventional variational autoencoders fail in modeling correlations
      between data points due to their use of factorized priors. Amortized Gaussian
      process inference through GP-VAEs has led to significant improvements in this
      regard, but is still inhibited by the intrinsic complexity of exact GP inference.
      We improve the scalability of these methods through principled sparse inference
      approaches. We propose a new scalable GP-VAE model that outperforms existing
      approaches in terms of runtime and memory footprint, is easy to implement, and
      allows for joint end-to-end optimization of all components.

    abstract: In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which
      each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class
      labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem
      can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is
      associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically.
      We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class
      labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach
      over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the
      correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance
      close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label.
      In contrast, naïve methods degrade rapidly as more ambiguity is introduced into
      the labels.

    abstract: The principle of independent causal mechanisms (ICM) states that generative
      processes of real world data consist of independent modules which do not influence
      or inform each other. While this idea has led to fruitful developments in the
      field of causal inference, it is not widely-known in the NLP community. In this
      work, we argue that the causal direction of the data collection process bears
      nontrivial implications that can explain a number of published NLP findings,
      such as differences in semi-supervised learning (SSL) and domain adaptation
      (DA) performance across different settings. We categorize common NLP tasks according
      to their causal direction and empirically assay the validity of the ICM principle
      for text data using minimum description length. We conduct an extensive meta-analysis
      of over 100 published SSL and 30 DA studies, and find that the results are consistent
      with our expectations based on causal insights. This work presents the first
      attempt to analyze the ICM principle in NLP, and provides constructive suggestions
      for future modeling choices.

    abstract: This paper presents a tutorial introduction to the use of variational
      methods for inference and learning in graphical models (Bayesian networks and
      Markov random fields). We present a number of examples of graphical models,
      including the QMR-DT database, the sigmoid belief network, the Boltzmann machine,
      and several variants of hidden Markov models, in which it is infeasible to run
      exact inference algorithms. We then introduce variational methods, which exploit
      laws of large numbers to transform the original graphical model into a simplified
      graphical model in which inference is efficient. Inference in the simpified
      model provides bounds on probabilities of interest in the original model. We
      describe a general framework for generating variational transformations based
      on convex duality. Finally we return to the examples and demonstrate how variational
      algorithms can be formulated in each case.

    abstract: Recent work has discussed the limitations of counterfactual explanations
      to recommend actions for algorithmic recourse, and argued for the need of taking
      causal relationships between features into consideration. Unfortunately, in
      practice, the true underlying structural causal model is generally unknown.
      In this work, we first show that it is impossible to guarantee recourse without
      access to the true structural equations. To address this limitation, we propose
      two probabilistic approaches to select optimal actions that achieve recourse
      with high probability given limited causal knowledge (e.g., only the causal
      graph). The first captures uncertainty over structural equations under additive
      Gaussian noise, and uses Bayesian model averaging to estimate the counterfactual
      distribution. The second removes any assumptions on the structural equations
      by instead computing the average effect of recourse actions on individuals similar
      to the person who seeks recourse, leading to a novel subpopulation-based interventional
      notion of recourse. We then derive a gradient-based procedure for selecting
      optimal recourse actions, and empirically show that the proposed approaches
      lead to more reliable recommendations under imperfect causal knowledge than
      non-probabilistic baselines.

    abstract: The opinions, expectations and behavior of citizens are increasingly
      reflected online — therefore, mining the internet for such data can enhance
      decision-making in public policy, communications, marketing, finance and other
      fields. However, to come closer to the representativeness of classic opinion
      surveys there is a lack of knowledge about the sociodemographic characteristics
      of those voicing opinions on the internet. This paper proposes to calibrate
      online opinions aggregated from multiple and heterogeneous data sources with
      traditional surveys enhanced with rich socio-demographic information to enable
      insights into which opinions are expressed on the internet by specific segments
      of society. The goal of this research is to provide professionals in citizen-
      and consumer- centered domains with more concise near real-time intelligence
      on online opinions. To become effective, the methodologies presented in this
      paper must be integrated into a coherent decision support system.

    abstract: Current knowledge bases suffer from either low coverage or low accuracy.
      The underlying hypothesis of this work is that user feedback can greatly improve
      the quality of automatically extracted knowledge bases. The feedback could help
      quantify the uncertainty associated with the stored statements and would enable
      mechanisms for searching, ranking and reasoning at entity-relationship level.
      Most importantly, a principled model for exploiting user feedback to learn the
      truth values of statements in the knowledge base would be a major step forward
      in addressing the issue of knowledge base curation. We present a family of probabilistic
      graphical models that builds on user feedback and logical inference rules derived
      from the popular Semantic-Web formalism of RDFS <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/">[1]</a>.
      Through internal inference and belief propagation, these models can learn both,
      the truth values of the statements in the knowledge base and the reliabilities
      of the users who give feedback. We demonstrate the viability of our approach
      in extensive experiments on real-world datasets, with feedback collected from
      Amazon Mechanical Turk.

    abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Modern DNA sequencing methods produce vast amounts of data
      that often requires mapping to a reference genome. Most existing programs use
      the number of mismatches between the read and the genome as a measure of quality.
      This approach is without a statistical foundation and can for some data types
      result in many wrongly mapped reads. Here we present a probabilistic mapping
      method based on position-specific scoring matrices, which can take into account
      not only the quality scores of the reads but also user-specified models of evolution
      and data-specific biases.RESULTS:We show how evolution, data-specific biases,
      and sequencing errors are naturally dealt with probabilistically. Our method
      achieves better results than Bowtie and BWA on simulated and real ancient and
      PAR-CLIP reads, as well as on simulated reads from the AT rich organism P. falciparum,
      when modeling the biases of these data. For simulated Illumina reads, the method
      has consistently higher sensitivity for both single-end and paired-end data.
      We also show that our probabilistic approach can limit the problem of random
      matches from short reads of contamination and that it improves the mapping of
      real reads from one organism (D. melanogaster) to a related genome (D. simulans).
      CONCLUSION: The presented work is an implementation of a novel approach to short
      read mapping where quality scores, prior mismatch probabilities and mapping
      qualities are handled in a statistically sound manner. The resulting implementation
      provides not only a tool for biologists working with low quality and/or biased
      sequencing data but also a demonstration of the feasibility of using a probability
      based alignment method on real and simulated data sets.'

    abstract: 'Influence maximization is a widely studied topic in network science,
      where the aim is to reach the maximum possible number of nodes, while only targeting
      a small initial set of individuals. It has critical applications in many fields,
      including viral marketing, information propagation, news dissemination, and
      vaccinations. However, the objective does not usually take into account whether
      the final set of influenced nodes is fair with respect to sensitive attributes,
      such as race or gender. Here we address fair influence maximization, aiming
      to reach minorities more equitably. We introduce Adversarial Graph Embeddings:
      we co-train an auto-encoder for graph embedding and a discriminator to discern
      sensitive attributes. This leads to embeddings which are similarly distributed
      across sensitive attributes. We then find a good initial set by clustering the
      embeddings. We believe we are the first to use embeddings for the task of fair
      influence maximization. While there are typically trade-offs between fairness
      and influence maximization objectives, our experiments on synthetic and real-world
      datasets show that our approach dramatically reduces disparity while remaining
      competitive with state-of-the-art influence maximization methods.'

    abstract: 'Causal approaches to fairness have seen substantial recent interest,
      both from the machine learning community and from wider parties interested in
      ethical prediction algorithms. In no small part, this has been due to the fact
      that causal models allow one to simultaneously leverage data and expert knowledge
      to remove discriminatory effects from predictions. However, one of the primary
      assumptions in causal modeling is that you know the causal graph. This introduces
      a new opportunity for bias, caused by misspecifying the causal model. One common
      way for misspecification to occur is via unmeasured confounding: the true causal
      effect between variables is partially described by unobserved quantities. In
      this work we design tools to assess the sensitivity of fairness measures to
      this confounding for the popular class of non-linear additive noise models (ANMs).
      Specifically, we give a procedure for computing the maximum difference between
      two counterfactually fair predictors, where one has become biased due to confounding.
      For the case of bivariate confounding our technique can be swiftly computed
      via a sequence of closed-form updates. For multivariate confounding we give
      an algorithm that can be efficiently solved via automatic differentiation. We
      demonstrate our new sensitivity analysis tools in real-world fairness scenarios
      to assess the bias arising from confounding.'

    abstract: Recent work has explored how to train machine learning models which
      do not discriminate against any subgroup of the population as determined by
      sensitive attributes such as gender or race. To avoid disparate treatment, sensitive
      attributes should not be considered. On the other hand, in order to avoid disparate
      impact, sensitive attributes must be examined — e.g., in order to learn a fair
      model, or to check if a given model is fair. We introduce methods from secure
      multi-party computation which allow us to avoid both. By encrypting sensitive
      attributes, we show how an outcome based fair model may be learned, checked,
      or have its outputs verified and held to account, without users revealing their
      sensitive attributes.

    abstract: Consequential decisions are increasingly informed by sophisticated data-driven
      predictive models. However, consistently learning accurate predictive models
      requires access to ground truth labels. Unfortunately, in practice, labels may
      only exist conditional on certain decisions—if a loan is denied, there is not
      even an option for the individual to pay back the loan. In this paper, we show
      that, in this selective labels setting, learning to predict is suboptimal in
      terms of both fairness and utility. To avoid this undesirable behavior, we propose
      to directly learn stochastic decision policies that maximize utility under fairness
      constraints. In the context of fair machine learning, our results suggest the
      need for a paradigm shift from "learning to predict" to "learning to decide".
      Experiments on synthetic and real-world data illustrate the favorable properties
      of learning to decide, in terms of both utility and fairness.

    abstract: 'Recent work on fairness in machine learning has focused on various
      statistical discrimination criteria and how they trade off. Most of these criteria
      are observational: They depend only on the joint distribution of predictor,
      protected attribute, features, and outcome. While convenient to work with, observational
      criteria have severe inherent limitations that prevent them from resolving matters
      of fairness conclusively. Going beyond observational criteria, we frame the
      problem of discrimination based on protected attributes in the language of causal
      reasoning. This viewpoint shifts attention from “What is the right fairness
      criterion?” to “What do we want to assume about our model of the causal data
      generating process?” Through the lens of causality, we make several contributions.
      First, we crisply articulate why and when observational criteria fail, thus
      formalizing what was before a matter of opinion. Second, our approach exposes
      previously ignored subtleties and why they are fundamental to the problem. Finally,
      we put forward natural causal non-discrimination criteria and develop algorithms
      that satisfy them.'

    abstract: Gaussian process classifiers (GPCs) are Bayesian probabilistic kernel
      classifiers. In GPCs, the probability of belonging to a certain class at an
      input location is monotonically related to the value of some latent function
      at that location. Starting from a Gaussian process prior over this latent function,
      data are used to infer both the posterior over the latent function and the values
      of hyperparameters to determine various aspects of the function. Recently, the
      expectation propagation (EP) approach has been proposed to infer the posterior
      over the latent function. Based on this work, we present an approximate EM algorithm,
      the EM-EP algorithm, to learn both the latent function and the hyperparameters.
      This algorithm is found to converge in practice and provides an efficient Bayesian
      framework for learning hyperparameters of the kernel. A multiclass extension
      of the EM-EP algorithm for GPCs is also derived. In the experimental results,
      the EM-EP algorithms are as good or better than other methods for GPCs or Support
      Vector Machines (SVMs) with cross-validation.

    abstract: Bayesian model averaging linearly mixes the probabilistic predictions
      of multiple models, each weighted by its posterior probability. This is the
      coherent Bayesian way of combining multiple models only under certain restrictive
      assumptions, which we outline. We explore a general framework for Bayesian model
      combination (which differs from model averaging) in the context of classification.
      This framework explicitly models the relationship between each model’s output
      and the unknown true label. The framework does not require that the models be
      probabilistic (they can even be human assessors), that they share prior information
      or receive the same training data, or that they be independent in their errors.
      Finally, the Bayesian combiner does not need to believe any of the models is
      in fact correct. We test several variants of this classifier combination procedure
      starting from a classic statistical model proposed by Dawid and Skene (1979)
      and using MCMC to add more complex but important features to the model. Comparisons
      on sev- eral data sets to simpler methods like majority voting show that the
      Bayesian methods not only perform well but result in interpretable diagnostics
      on the data points and the models.

    abstract: This paper concerns the gender classification task of discriminating
      between images of faces of men and women from face images. In appearance-based
      approaches, the initial images are preprocessed (e.g. normalized) and input
      into classifiers. Recently, support vector machines (SVMs) which are popular
      kernel classifiers have been applied to gender classification and have shown
      excellent performance. SVMs have difficulty in determining the hyperparameters
      in kernels (using cross-validation). We propose to use Gaussian process classifiers
      (GPCs) which are Bayesian kernel classifiers. The main advantage of GPCs over
      SVMs is that they determine the hyperparameters of the kernel based on Bayesian
      model selection criterion. The experimental results show that our methods outperformed
      SVMs with cross-validation in most of data sets. Moreover, the kernel hyperparameters
      found by GPCs using Bayesian methods can be used to improve SVM performance.

    abstract: We demonstrate efficient approximate inference for the Dirichlet Diffusion
      Tree (Neal, 2003), a Bayesian nonparametric prior over tree structures. Although
      DDTs provide a powerful and elegant approach for modeling hierarchies they haven't
      seen much use to date. One problem is the computational cost of MCMC inference.
      We provide the first deterministic approximate inference methods for DDT models
      and show excellent performance compared to the MCMC alternative. We present
      message passing algorithms to approximate the Bayesian model evidence for a
      specific tree. This is used to drive sequential tree building and greedy search
      to find optimal tree structures, corresponding to hierarchical clusterings of
      the data. We demonstrate appropriate observation models for continuous and binary
      data. The empirical performance of our method is very close to the computationally
      expensive MCMC alternative on a density estimation problem, and significantly
      outperforms kernel density estimators.

    abstract: A nonparametric Bayesian extension of Independent Components Analysis
      (ICA) is proposed where observed data Y is modelled as a linear superposition,
      G, of a potentially infinite number of hidden sources, X. Whether a given source
      is active for a specific data point is specified by an infinite binary matrix,
      Z. The resulting sparse representation allows increased data reduction compared
      to standard ICA. We define a prior on Z using the Indian Buffet Process (IBP).
      We describe four variants of the model, with Gaussian or Laplacian priors on
      X and the one or two-parameter IBPs. We demonstrate Bayesian inference under
      these models using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm on synthetic

      age in a scientifically meaningful way? We investigate these questions using
      ageing related phenotypes measured on the 12,000 female twins in the Twins UK
      study. We propose a simple linear model of ageing, which allows a latent adjustment
      to be made to an individual's chronological age to give her "physiological age",
      shared across the observed phenotypes. We note problems with the analysis resulting
      from the linearity assumption and show how to alleviate these issues using a
      non-linear extension. We find more gene expression probes are significantly
      associated with our measurement of physiological age than to chronological age.

    abstract: In this paper an alternative approach to black-box identification of
      non-linear dynamic systems is compared with the more established approach of
      using artificial neural networks. The Gaussian process prior approach is a representative
      of non-parametric modelling approaches. It was compared on a pH process modelling
      case study. The purpose of modelling was to use the model for control design.
      The comparison revealed that even though Gaussian process models can be effectively
      used for modelling dynamic systems caution has to be axercised when signals
      are selected.

    abstract: Gaussian process models provide a probabilistic non-parametric modelling
      approach for black-box identi cation of non-linear dynamic systems. The Gaussian
      processes can highlight areas of the input space where prediction quality is
      poor, due to the lack of data or its complexity, by indicating the higher variance
      around the predicted mean. Gaussian process models contain noticeably less coef
      cients to be optimised. This paper illustrates possible application of Gaussian
      process models within model-based predictive control. The extra information
      provided within Gaussian process model is used in predictive control, where
      optimisation of control signal takes the variance information into account.
      The predictive control principle is demonstrated on control of pH process benchmark.

    abstract: In recent years, MEMS inertial sensors (3D accelerometers and 3D gyroscopes)
      have become widely available due to their small size and low cost. Inertial
      sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated
      to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate
      on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales.
      To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional
      sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects
      of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different
      modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms
      include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally
      cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations. The
      quality of their estimates is illustrated using both experimental and simulated
      data.

    abstract: We present a method for scalable and fully 3D magnetic field simultaneous
      localisation and mapping (SLAM) using local anomalies in the magnetic field
      as a source of position information. These anomalies are due to the presence
      of ferromagnetic material in the structure of buildings and in objects such
      as furniture. We represent the magnetic field map using a Gaussian process model
      and take well-known physical properties of the magnetic field into account.
      We build local magnetic field maps using three-dimensional hexagonal block tiling.
      To make our approach computationally tractable we use reduced-rank Gaussian
      process regression in combination with a Rao–Blackwellised particle filter.
      We show that it is possible to obtain accurate position and orientation estimates
      using measurements from a smartphone, and that our approach provides a scalable
      magnetic SLAM algorithm in terms of both computational complexity and map storage.

    abstract: Can we make Bayesian posterior MCMC sampling more efficient when faced
      with very large datasets? We argue that computing the likelihood for N datapoints
      in the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) test to reach a single binary decision is computationally
      inefficient. We introduce an approximate MH rule based on a sequential hypothesis
      test that allows us to accept or reject samples with high confidence using only
      a fraction of the data required for the exact MH rule. While this method introduces
      an asymptotic bias, we show that this bias can be controlled and is more than
      offset by a decrease in variance due to our ability to draw more samples per
      unit of time.

    abstract: We report an experimental realization of an adaptive quantum state tomography
      protocol. Our method takes advantage of a Bayesian approach to statistical inference
      and is naturally tailored for adaptive strategies. For pure states we observe
      close to N^-1 scaling of infidelity with overall number of registered events,
      while best non-adaptive protocols allow for N^-1/2 scaling only. Experiments
      are performed for polarization qubits, but the approach is readily adapted to
      any dimension.

    abstract: We study the problem of causal discovery through targeted interventions.
      Starting from few observational measurements, we follow a Bayesian active learning
      approach to perform those experiments which, in expectation with respect to
      the current model, are maximally informative about the underlying causal structure.
      Unlike previous work, we consider the setting of continuous random variables
      with non-linear functional relationships, modelled with Gaussian process priors.
      To address the arising problem of choosing from an uncountable set of possible
      interventions, we propose to use Bayesian optimisation to efficiently maximise
      a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected information gain.

    abstract: 'We point out an instantiation of Simpson''s paradox in COVID-19 case
      fatality rates (cfrs): comparing a large-scale study from China (February 17)
      with early reports from Italy (March 9), we find that cfrs are lower in Italy
      for every age group, but higher overall. This phenomenon is explained by a stark
      difference in case demographic between the two countries. Using this as a motivating
      example, we introduce basic concepts from mediation analysis and show how these
      can be used to quantify different direct and indirect effects when assuming
      a coarse-grained causal graph involving country, age, and case fatality. We
      curate an age-stratified cfr dataset with >750 k cases and conduct a case study,
      investigating total, direct, and indirect (age-mediated) causal effects between
      different countries and at different points in time. This allows us to separate
      age-related effects from others unrelated to age and facilitates a more transparent
      comparison of cfrs across countries at different stages of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      Using longitudinal data from Italy, we discover a sign reversal of the direct
      causal effect in mid-March, which temporally aligns with the reported collapse
      of the healthcare system in parts of the country. Moreover, we find that direct
      and indirect effects across 132 pairs of countries are only weakly correlated,
      suggesting that a country''s policy and case demographic may be largely unrelated.
      We point out limitations and extensions for future work, and finally, discuss
      the role of causal reasoning in the broader context of using AI to combat the
      COVID-19 pandemic.'

    abstract: Current methods for covariate-shift adaptation use unlabelled data to
      compute importance weights or domain-invariant features, while the final model
      is trained on labelled data only. Here, we consider a particular case of covariate
      shift which allows us also to learn from unlabelled data, that is, combining
      adaptation with semi-supervised learning. Using ideas from causality, we argue
      that this requires learning with both causes, X_C, and effects, X_E, of a target
      variable, Y, and show how this setting leads to what we call a semi-generative
      model, P(Y,X_E|X_C,θ). Our approach is robust to domain shifts in the distribution
      of causal features and leverages unlabelled data by learning a direct map from
      causes to effects. Experiments on synthetic data demonstrate significant improvements
      in classification over purely-supervised and importance-weighting baselines.

    abstract: While the success of semi-supervised learning (SSL) is still not fully
      understood, Schölkopf et al. (2012) have established a link to the principle
      of independent causal mechanisms. They conclude that SSL should be impossible
      when predicting a target variable from its causes, but possible when predicting
      it from its effects. Since both these cases are restrictive, we extend their
      work by considering classification using cause and effect features at the same
      time, such as predicting a disease from both risk factors and symptoms. While
      standard SSL exploits information contained in the marginal distribution of
      all inputs (to improve the estimate of the conditional distribution of the target
      given in-puts), we argue that in our more general setting we should use information
      in the conditional distribution of effect features given causal features. We
      explore how this insight generalises the previous understanding, and how it
      relates to and can be exploited algorithmically for SSL.

    abstract: Learning how to model complex scenes in a modular way with recombinable
      components is a pre-requisite for higher-order reasoning and acting in the physical
      world. However, current generative models lack the ability to capture the inherently
      compositional and layered nature of visual scenes. While recent work has made
      progress towards unsupervised learning of object-based scene representations,
      most models still maintain a global representation space (i.e., objects are
      not explicitly separated), and cannot generate scenes with novel object arrangement
      and depth ordering. Here, we present an alternative approach which uses an inductive
      bias encouraging modularity by training an ensemble of generative models (experts).
      During training, experts compete for explaining parts of a scene, and thus specialise
      on different object classes, with objects being identified as parts that re-occur
      across multiple scenes. Our model allows for controllable sampling of individual
      objects and recombination of experts in physically plausible ways. In contrast
      to other methods, depth layering and occlusion are handled correctly, moving
      this approach closer to a causal generative scene model. Experiments on simple
      toy data qualitatively demonstrate the conceptual advantages of the proposed
      approach.

    abstract: Self-supervised representation learning has shown remarkable success
      in a number of domains. A common practice is to perform data augmentation via
      hand-crafted transformations intended to leave the semantics of the data invariant.
      We seek to understand the empirical success of this approach from a theoretical
      perspective. We formulate the augmentation process as a latent variable model
      by postulating a partition of the latent representation into a content component,
      which is assumed invariant to augmentation, and a style component, which is
      allowed to change. Unlike prior work on disentanglement and independent component
      analysis, we allow for both nontrivial statistical and causal dependencies in
      the latent space. We study the identifiability of the latent representation
      based on pairs of views of the observations and prove sufficient conditions
      that allow us to identify the invariant content partition up to an invertible
      mapping in both generative and discriminative settings. We find numerical simulations
      with dependent latent variables are consistent with our theory. Lastly, we introduce
      Causal3DIdent, a dataset of high-dimensional, visually complex images with rich
      causal dependencies, which we use to study the effect of data augmentations
      performed in practice.

    abstract: Algorithmic fairness is typically studied from the perspective of predictions.
      Instead, here we investigate fairness from the perspective of recourse actions
      suggested to individuals to remedy an unfavourable classification. We propose
      two new fairness criteria at the group and individual level, which – unlike
      prior work on equalising the average group-wise distance from the decision boundary
      – explicitly account for causal relationships between features, thereby capturing
      downstream effects of recourse actions performed in the physical world. We explore
      how our criteria relate to others, such as counterfactual fairness, and show
      that fairness of recourse is complementary to fairness of prediction. We study
      theoretically and empirically how to enforce fair causal recourse by altering
      the classifier and perform a case study on the Adult dataset. Finally, we discuss
      whether fairness violations in the data generating process revealed by our criteria
      may be better addressed by societal interventions as opposed to constraints
      on the classifier.

    abstract: Gaussian process (GP) priors have been successfully used in non-parametric
      Bayesian regression and classification models. Inference can be performed analytically
      only for the regression model with Gaussian noise. For all other likelihood
      models inference is intractable and various approximation techniques have been
      proposed. In recent years expectation-propagation (EP) has been developed as
      a general method for approximate inference. This article provides a general
      summary of how expectation-propagation can be used for approximate inference
      in Gaussian process models. Furthermore we present a case study describing its
      implementation for a new robust variant of Gaussian process regression. To gain
      further insights into the quality of the EP approximation we present experiments
      in which we compare to results obtained by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling.

    abstract: We consider the problem of approximate inference in the context of Bayesian
      decision theory. Traditional approaches focus on approximating general properties
      of the posterior, ignoring the decision task – and associated losses – for which
      the posterior could be used. We argue that this can be suboptimal and propose
      instead to loss-calibrate the approximate inference methods with respect to
      the decision task at hand. We present a general framework rooted in Bayesian
      decision theory to analyze approximate inference from the perspective of losses,
      opening up several research directions. As a first loss-calibrated approximate
      inference attempt, we propose an EM-like algorithm on the Bayesian posterior
      risk and show how it can improve a standard approach to Gaussian process classification
      when losses are asymmetric.

    abstract: The Internet has enabled the creation of a growing number of large-scale
      knowledge bases in a variety of domains containing complementary information.
      Tools for automatically aligning these knowledge bases would make it possible
      to unify many sources of structured knowledge and answer complex queries. However,
      the efficient alignment of large-scale knowledge bases still poses a considerable
      challenge. Here, we present Simple Greedy Matching (SiGMa), a simple algorithm
      for aligning knowledge bases with millions of entities and facts. SiGMa is an
      iterative propagation algorithm which leverages both the structural information
      from the relationship graph as well as flexible similarity measures between
      entity properties in a greedy local search, thus making it scalable. Despite
      its greedy nature, our experiments indicate that SiGMa can efficiently match
      some of the world's largest knowledge bases with high precision. We provide
      additional experiments on benchmark datasets which demonstrate that SiGMa can
      outperform state-of-the-art approaches both in accuracy and efficiency.

    abstract: The kernel function and its hyperparameters are the central model selection
      choice in a Gaussian process [Rasmussen and Williams, 2006]. Typically, the
      hyperparameters of the kernel are chosen by maximising the marginal likelihood,
      an approach known as Type-II maximum likelihood (ML-II). However, ML-II does
      not account for hyperparameter uncertainty, and it is well-known that this can
      lead to severely biased estimates and an underestimation of predictive uncertainty.
      While there are several works which employ a fully Bayesian characterisation
      of GPs, relatively few propose such approaches for the sparse GPs paradigm.
      In this work we propose an algorithm for sparse Gaussian process regression
      which leverages MCMC to sample from the hyperparameter posterior within the
      variational inducing point framework of [Titsias, 2009]. This work is closely
      related to Hensman et al. [2015b], but side-steps the need to sample the inducing
      points, thereby significantly improving sampling efficiency in the Gaussian
      likelihood case. We compare this scheme against natural baselines in literature
      along with stochastic variational GPs (SVGPs) along with an extensive computational
      analysis.

    abstract: 'Learning in Gaussian Process models occurs through the adaptation of
      hyperparameters of the mean and the covariance function. The classical approach
      entails maximizing the marginal likelihood yielding fixed point estimates (an
      approach called Type II maximum likelihood or ML-II). An alternative learning
      procedure is to infer the posterior over hyper-parameters in a hierarchical
      specication of GPs we call Fully Bayesian Gaussian Process Regression (GPR).
      This work considers two approximation schemes for the intractable hyperparameter
      posterior: 1) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) yielding a sampling based approximation
      and 2) Variational Inference (VI) where the posterior over hyperparameters is
      approximated by a factorized Gaussian (mean-field) or a full-rank Gaussian accounting
      for correlations between hyperparameters. We analyse the predictive performance
      for fully Bayesian GPR on a range of benchmark data sets.'

    abstract: Gaussian process latent variable models (GPLVM) are a flexible and non-linear
      approach to dimensionality reduction, extending classical Gaussian processes
      to an unsupervised learning context. The Bayesian incarnation of the GPLVM uses
      a variational framework, where the posterior over latent variables is approximated
      by a well-behaved variational family, a factorised Gaussian yielding a tractable
      lower bound. However, the non-factorisability of the lower bound prevents truly
      scalable inference. In this work, we study the doubly stochastic formulation
      of the Bayesian GPLVM model amenable with minibatch training. We show how this
      framework is compatible with different latent variable formulations and perform
      experiments to compare a suite of models. Further, we demonstrate how we can
      train in the presence of massively missing data and obtain high-fidelity reconstructions.
      We demonstrate the model’s performance by benchmarking against the canonical
      sparse GPLVM for high dimensional data examples.

    abstract: The Upper Indus Basin, Himalayas provides water for 270 million people
      and countless ecosystems. However, precipitation, a key component to hydrological
      modelling, is poorly understood in this area. A key challenge surrounding this
      uncertainty comes from the complex spatial-temporal distribution of precipitation
      across the basin. In this work we propose Gaussian processes with structured
      non-stationary kernels to model precipitation patterns in the UIB. Previous
      attempts to quantify or model precipitation in the Hindu Kush Karakoram Himalayan
      region have often been qualitative or include crude assumptions and simplifications
      which cannot be resolved at lower resolutions. This body of research also provides
      little to no error propagation. We account for the spatial variation in precipitation
      with a non-stationary Gibbs kernel parameterised with an input dependent lengthscale.
      This allows the posterior function samples to adapt to the varying precipitation
      patterns inherent in the distinct underlying topography of the Indus region.
      The input dependent lengthscale is governed by a latent Gaussian process with
      a stationary squared-exponential kernel to allow the function level hyperparameters
      to vary smoothly. In ablation experiments we motivate each component of the
      proposed kernel by demonstrating its ability to model the spatial covariance,
      temporal structure and joint spatio-temporal reconstruction. We benchmark our
      model with a stationary Gaussian process and a Deep Gaussian processes.

    abstract: 'Background: Global sustainability is an enmeshed system of complex
      socioeconomic, climatological, and ecological interactions. The numerous objectives
      of the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Agreement have
      various levels of interdependence, making it difficult to ascertain the influence
      of changes to particular indicators across the whole system. In this analysis,
      we aimed to detect and rank the complex interlinkages between objectives of
      sustainability agendas. Methods: We developed a method to find interlinkages
      among the 17 SDGs and climate change, including non-linear and non-monotonic
      dependences. We used time series of indicators defined by the World Bank, consisting
      of 400 indicators that measure progress towards the 17 SDGs and an 18th variable
      (annual average temperatures), representing progress in the response to the
      climate crisis, from 2000 to 2019. This method detects significant dependencies
      among the time evolution of the objectives by using partial distance correlations,
      a non-linear measure of conditional dependence that also discounts spurious
      correlations originating from lurking variables. We then used a network representation
      to identify the most important objectives (using network centrality) and to
      obtain nexuses of objectives (defined as highly interconnected clusters in the
      network). Findings: Using temporal data from 181 countries spanning 20 years,
      we analysed dependencies among SDGs and climate for 35 country groupings based
      on region, development, and income level. The observed significant interlinkages,
      central objectives, and nexuses identified varied greatly across country groupings;
      however, SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals) and climate change ranked as highly
      important across many country groupings. Temperature rise was strongly linked
      to urbanisation, air pollution, and slum expansion (SDG 11), especially in country
      groupings likely to be worst affected by climate breakdown, such as Africa.
      In several country groupings composed of developing nations, we observed a consistent
      nexus of strongly interconnected objectives formed by SDG 1 (poverty reduction),
      SDG 4 (education), and SDG 8 (economic growth), sometimes incorporating SDG
      5 (gender equality), and SDG 16 (peace and justice). Interpretation: The differences
      across groupings emphasise the need to define goals in accordance with local
      circumstances and priorities. Our analysis highlights global partnerships (SDG
      17) as a pivot in global sustainability efforts, which have been strongly linked
      to economic growth (SDG 8). However, if economic growth and trade expansion
      were repositioned as a means instead of an end goal of development, our analysis
      showed that education (SDG 4) and poverty reduction (SDG 1) become more central,
      thus suggesting that these could be prioritised in global partnerships. Urban
      livelihoods (SDG 11) were also flagged as important to avoid replicating unsustainable
      patterns of the past.'

    abstract: We present a new sparse Gaussian Process (GP) model for regression.
      The key novel idea is to sparsify the spectral representation of the GP. This
      leads to a simple, practical algorithm for regression tasks. We compare the
      achievable trade-offs between predictive accuracy and computational requirements,
      and show that these are typically superior to existing state-of-the-art sparse
      approximations. We discuss both the weight space and function space representations,
      and note that the new construction implies priors over functions which are always
      stationary, and can approximate any covariance function in this class.

    abstract: Prosodic rhythm in speech [the alternation of "Strong" (S) and "weak"
      (w) syllables] is cued, among others, by slow rates of amplitude modulation
      (AM) within the speech envelope. However, it is unclear exactly which envelope
      modulation rates and statistics are the most important for the rhythm percept.
      Here, the hypothesis that the phase relationship between "Stress" rate ( 2 Hz)
      and "Syllable" rate ( 4 Hz) AMs provides a perceptual cue for speech rhythm
      is tested. In a rhythm judgment task, adult listeners identified AM tone-vocoded
      nursery rhyme sentences that carried either trochaic (S-w) or iambic patterning
      (w-S). Manipulation of listeners' rhythm perception was attempted by parametrically
      phase-shifting the Stress AM and Syllable AM in the vocoder. It was expected
      that a 1π radian phase-shift (half a cycle) would reverse the perceived rhythm
      pattern (i.e., trochaic -> iambic) whereas a 2πradian shift (full cycle) would
      retain the perceived rhythm pattern (i.e., trochaic -> trochaic). The results
      confirmed these predictions. Listeners judgments of rhythm systematically followed
      Stress-Syllable AM phase-shifts, but were unaffected by phase-shifts between
      the Syllable AM and the Sub-beat AM ( 14 Hz) in a control condition. It is concluded
      that the Stress-Syllable AM phase relationship is an envelope-based modulation
      statistic that supports speech rhythm perception.

    abstract: 'How can we generate realistic networks? In addition, how can we do
      so with a mathematically tractable model that allows for rigorous analysis of
      network properties? Real networks exhibit a long list of surprising properties:
      Heavy tails for the in- and out-degree distribution, heavy tails for the eigenvalues
      and eigenvectors, small diameters, and densification and shrinking diameters
      over time. Current network models and generators either fail to match several
      of the above properties, are complicated to analyze mathematically, or both.
      Here we propose a generative model for networks that is both mathematically
      tractable and can generate networks that have all the above mentioned structural
      properties. Our main idea here is to use a non-standard matrix operation, the
      Kronecker product, to generate graphs which we refer to as "Kronecker graphs".<br>First,
      we show that Kronecker graphs naturally obey common network properties. In fact,
      we rigorously prove that they do so. We also provide empirical evidence showing
      that Kronecker graphs can effectively model the structure of real networks.<br>We
      then present KRONFIT, a fast and scalable algorithm for fitting the Kronecker
      graph generation model to large real networks. A naive approach to fitting would
      take super-exponential time. In contrast, KRONFIT takes linear time, by exploiting
      the structure of Kronecker matrix multiplication and by using statistical simulation
      techniques. Experiments on a wide range of large real and synthetic networks
      show that KRONFIT finds accurate parameters that very well mimic the properties
      of target networks. In fact, using just four parameters we can accurately model
      several aspects of global network structure. Once fitted, the model parameters
      can be used to gain insights about the network structure, and the resulting
      synthetic graphs can be used for null-models, anonymization, extrapolations,
      and graph summarization.'

    abstract: To interpret uncertainty estimates from differentiable probabilistic
      models, recent work has proposed generating a single Counterfactual Latent Uncertainty
      Explanation (CLUE) for a given data point where the model is uncertain. We broaden
      the exploration to examine δ-CLUE, the set of potential CLUEs within a δ ball
      of the original input in latent space. We study the diversity of such sets and
      find that many CLUEs are redundant; as such, we propose DIVerse CLUE (∇-CLUE),
      a set of CLUEs which each propose a distinct explanation as to how one can decrease
      the uncertainty associated with an input. We then further propose GLobal AMortised
      CLUE (GLAM-CLUE), a distinct, novel method which learns amortised mappings that
      apply to specific groups of uncertain inputs, taking them and efficiently transforming
      them in a single function call into inputs for which a model will be certain.
      Our experiments show that δ-CLUE, ∇-CLUE, and GLAM-CLUE all address shortcomings
      of CLUE and provide beneficial explanations of uncertainty estimates to practitioners.

    abstract: 'To obtain uncertainty estimates with real-world Bayesian deep learning
      models, practical inference approximations are needed. Dropout variational inference
      (VI) for example has been used for machine vision and medical applications,
      but VI can severely underestimates model uncertainty. Alpha-divergences are
      alternative divergences to VI’s KL objective, which are able to avoid VI’s uncertainty
      underestimation. But these are hard to use in practice: existing techniques
      can only use Gaussian approximating distributions, and require existing models

      a re-parametrisation of the alpha-divergence objectives, deriving a simple inference
      technique which, together with dropout, can be easily implemented with existing
      models by simply changing the loss of the model. We demonstrate improved uncertainty

    abstract: 'Expectation propagation (EP) is a deterministic approximation algorithm
      that is often used to perform approximate Bayesian parameter learning. EP approximates
      the full intractable posterior distribution through a set of local-approximations
      that are iteratively refined for each datapoint. EP can offer analytic and computational
      advantages over other approximations, such as Variational Inference (VI), and
      is the method of choice for a number of models. The local nature of EP appears
      to make it an ideal candidate for performing Bayesian learning on large models
      in large-scale datasets settings. However, EP has a crucial limitation in this
      context: the number approximating factors needs to increase with the number
      of data-points, N, which often entails a prohibitively large memory overhead.
      This paper presents an extension to EP, called stochastic expectation propagation
      (SEP), that maintains a global posterior approximation (like VI) but updates
      it in a local way (like EP ). Experiments on a number of canonical learning
      problems using synthetic and real-world datasets indicate that SEP performs
      almost as well as full EP, but reduces the memory consumption by a factor of
      N. SEP is therefore ideally suited to performing approximate Bayesian learning
      in the large model, large dataset setting.'

    abstract: We present a VAE architecture for encoding and generating high dimensional
      sequential data, such as video or audio. Our deep generative model learns a
      latent representation of the data which is split into a static and dynamic part,
      allowing us to approximately disentangle latent time-dependent features (dynamics)
      from features which are preserved over time (content). This architecture gives
      us partial control over generating content and dynamics by conditioning on either
      one of these sets of features. In our experiments on artificially generated
      cartoon video clips and voice recordings, we show that we can convert the content
      of a given sequence into another one by such content swapping. For audio, this
      allows us to convert a male speaker into a female speaker and vice versa, while
      for video we can separately manipulate shapes and dynamics. Furthermore, we
      give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that stochastic RNNs as latent state
      models are more efficient at compressing and generating long sequences than
      deterministic ones, which may be relevant for applications in video compression.

    abstract: This paper introduces the variational Rényi bound (VR) that extends
      traditional variational inference to Rényi's alpha-divergences. This new family
      of variational methods unifies a number of existing approaches, and enables
      a smooth interpolation from the evidence lower-bound to the log (marginal) likelihood
      that is controlled by the value of alpha that parametrises the divergence. The
      reparameterization trick, Monte Carlo approximation and stochastic optimisation
      methods are deployed to obtain a tractable and unified framework for optimisation.
      We further consider negative alpha values and propose a novel variational inference
      method as a new special case in the proposed framework. Experiments on Bayesian
      neural networks and variational auto-encoders demonstrate the wide applicability
      of the VR bound.

    abstract: Implicit models, which allow for the generation of samples but not for
      point-wise evaluation of probabilities, are omnipresent in real-world problems
      tackled by machine learning and a hot topic of current research. Some examples
      include data simulators that are widely used in engineering and scientific research,
      generative adversarial networks (GANs) for image synthesis, and hot-off-the-press
      approximate inference techniques relying on implicit distributions. The majority
      of existing approaches to learning implicit models rely on approximating the
      intractable distribution or optimisation objective for gradient- based optimisation,
      which is liable to produce inaccurate updates and thus poor models. This paper
      alleviates the need for such approximations by proposing the Stein gradient
      estimator, which directly estimates the score function of the implicitly defined
      distribution. The efficacy of the proposed estimator is empirically demonstrated
      by examples that include meta-learning for approximate inference and entropy
      regularised GANs that provide improved sample diversities.

      to improve the accuracy of each individual task and achieve state-of-the-art
      results on 5 standard video- and audio-classification datasets. Co-training
      PolyViT on multiple modalities and tasks leads to a model that is even more
      parameter-efficient, and learns representations that generalize across multiple
      domains. Moreover, we show that co-training is simple and practical to implement,
      as we do not need to tune hyperparameters for each combination of datasets,
      but can simply adapt those from standard, single-task training.

    abstract: 'The Transformer architecture has revolutionized deep learning on sequential
      data, becoming ubiquitous in state-of-the-art solutions for a wide variety of
      applications. Yet vanilla Transformers are notoriously resource-expensive, requiring
      O(L2) in serial time and memory as functions of input length L. Recent works
      proposed various linear self-attention mechanisms, scaling only as O(L) for
      serial computation. We perform a thorough analysis of recent Transformer mechanisms
      with linear self-attention, Performers, in terms of overall computational complexity.
      We observe a remarkable computational flexibility: forward and backward propagation
      can be performed with no approximations using sublinear memory as a function
      of L (in addition to negligible storage for the input sequence), at a cost of
      greater time complexity in the parallel setting. In the extreme case, a Performer
      consumes only O(1) memory during training, and still requires O(L) time. This
      discovered time-memory tradeoff can be used for training or, due to complete
      backward-compatibility, for fine-tuning on a low-memory device, e.g. a smartphone
      or an earlier-generation GPU, thus contributing towards decentralized and democratized
      deep learning.'

    abstract: We introduce chefs' random tables (CRTs), a new class of non-trigonometric
      random features (RFs) to approximate Gaussian and softmax kernels. CRTs are
      an alternative to standard random kitchen sink (RKS) methods, which inherently
      rely on the trigonometric maps. We present variants of CRTs where RFs are positive,
      a key requirement for applications in recent low-rank Transformers. Further
      variance reduction is possible by leveraging statistics which are simple to
      compute. One instantiation of CRTs, the optimal positive random features (OPRFs),
      is to our knowledge the first RF method for unbiased softmax kernel estimation
      with positive and bounded RFs, resulting in exponentially small tails and much
      lower variance than its counterparts. As we show, orthogonal random features
      applied in OPRFs provide additional variance reduction for any dimensionality
      d (not only asymptotically for sufficiently large d, as for RKS). We test CRTs
      on many tasks ranging from non-parametric classification to training Transformers
      for text, speech and image data, obtaining new state-of-the-art results for
      low-rank text Transformers, while providing linear space and time complexity.

    abstract: We introduce an efficient approach for optimization over orthogonal
      groups on highly parallel computation units such as GPUs or TPUs. As in earlier
      work, we parametrize an orthogonal matrix as a product of Householder reflections.
      However, to overcome low parallelization capabilities of computing Householder
      reflections sequentially, we propose employing an accumulation scheme called
      the compact WY (or CWY) transform – a compact parallelization-friendly matrix
      representation for the series of Householder reflections. We further develop
      a novel Truncated CWY (or T-CWY) approach for Stiefel manifold parametrization
      which has a competitive complexity and, again, yields benefits when computed
      on GPUs and TPUs. We prove that our CWY and T-CWY methods lead to convergence
      to a stationary point of the training objective when coupled with stochastic
      gradient descent. We apply our methods to train recurrent neural network architectures
      in the tasks of neural machine translation and video prediction.

    abstract: Approximate bi-level optimization (ABLO) consists of (outer-level) optimization
      problems, involving numerical (inner-level) optimization loops. While ABLO has
      many applications across deep learning, it suffers from time and memory complexity
      proportional to the length r of its inner optimization loop. To address this
      complexity, an earlier first-order method (FOM) was proposed as a heuristic
      which omits second derivative terms, yielding significant speed gains and requiring
      only constant memory. Despite FOM’s popularity, there is a lack of theoretical
      understanding of its convergence properties. We contribute by theoretically
      characterizing FOM’s gradient bias under mild assumptions. We further demonstrate
      a rich family of examples where FOM-based SGD does not converge to a stationary
      point of the ABLO objective. We address this concern by proposing an unbiased
      FOM (UFOM) enjoying constant memory complexity as a function of r. We characterize
      the introduced time-variance tradeoff, demonstrate convergence bounds, and find
      an optimal UFOM for a given ABLO problem. Finally, we propose an efficient adaptive
      UFOM scheme.

    abstract: 'This paper presents stabilizing Model Predictive Controllers (MPC)
      in which prediction models are inferred from experimental data of the inputs
      and outputs of the plant. Using a nonparametric machine learning technique called
      LACKI, the estimated (possibly nonlinear) model function together with an estimation
      of Hoelder constant is provided. Based on these, a number of predictive controllers
      with stability guaranteed by design are proposed. Firstly, the case when the

      recursive feasibility is ensured by using tightened constraints in the optimisation
      problem. This controller has been extended to the more interesting and complex
      case: the online learning of the model, where the new data collected from feedback
      is added to enhance the prediction model. A on-line learning MPC based on a
      double sequence of predictions is proposed. Stability of the online learning
      MPC is proved. These controllers are illustrated by simulation.'

      topological properties are largely ignored; (iii) they lack a statistical interpretation.
      We argue that these common assumptions are often undesirable for network inference,

    abstract: This thesis makes contributions to a variety of aspects of probabilistic
      inference. When performing probabilistic inference, one must first represent
      one’s beliefs with a probability distribution. Specifying the details of a probability
      distribution can be a difficult task in many situations, but when expressing
      beliefs about complex data structures it may not even be apparent what form
      such a distribution should take. This thesis starts by demonstrating how representation
      theorems due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg can be used to specify appropriate
      models for data in the form of networks. These theorems are then extended in
      order to reveal appropriate probability distributions for arbitrary relational
      data or databases. A simpler data structure to specify probability distributions
      for is that of functions; many probability distributions for functions have
      been used for centuries. We demonstrate that many of these distributions can
      be expressed in a common language of Gaussian process kernels constructed from
      a few base elements and operators. The structure of this language allows for
      the effective automatic construction of probabilistic models for functions.
      Furthermore, the formal mathematical language of kernels can be mapped neatly
      onto natural language allowing for automatic descriptions of the automatically
      constructed models. By further automating the construction of statistical models,
      the need to be able to effectively check or criticise these models becomes greater.
      This thesis demonstrates how kernel two sample tests can be used to demonstrate
      where a probabilistic model most disagrees with data allowing for targeted improvements
      to the model. In proposing a new method of model criticism this thesis also
      briefly discusses the philosophy of model criticism within the context of probabilistic
      inference.

    abstract: This paper presents the beginnings of an automatic statistician, focusing
      on regression problems. Our system explores an open-ended space of statistical
      models to discover a good explanation of a data set, and then produces a detailed
      report with figures and natural-language text. Our approach treats unknown regression
      functions nonparametrically using Gaussian processes, which has two important
      consequences. First, Gaussian processes can model functions in terms of high-level
      properties (e.g. smoothness, trends, periodicity, changepoints). Taken together
      with the compositional structure of our language of models this allows us to
      automatically describe functions in simple terms. Second, the use of flexible
      nonparametric models and a rich language for composing them in an open-ended
      manner also results in state-of-the-art extrapolation performance evaluated
      over 13 real time series data sets from various domains.

    abstract: We propose an exploratory approach to statistical model criticism using
      maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) two sample tests. Typical approaches to model
      criticism require a practitioner to select a statistic by which to measure discrepancies
      between data and a statistical model. MMD two sample tests are instead constructed
      as an analytic maximisation over a large space of possible statistics and therefore
      automatically select the statistic which most shows any discrepancy. We demonstrate
      on synthetic data that the selected statistic, called the witness function,
      can be used to identify where a statistical model most misrepresents the data
      it was trained on. We then apply the procedure to real data where the models
      being assessed are restricted Boltzmann machines, deep belief networks and Gaussian
      process regression and demonstrate the ways in which these models fail to capture
      the properties of the data they are trained on.

    abstract: A fundamental problem in the analysis of structured relational data
      like graphs, networks, databases, and matrices is to extract a summary of the
      common structure underlying relations between individual entities. Relational
      data are typically encoded in the form of arrays; invariance to the ordering
      of rows and columns corresponds to exchangeable arrays. Results in probability
      theory due to Aldous, Hoover and Kallenberg show that exchangeable arrays can
      be represented in terms of a random measurable function which constitutes the
      natural model parameter in a Bayesian model. We obtain a flexible yet simple
      Bayesian nonparametric model by placing a Gaussian process prior on the parameter
      function. Efficient inference utilises elliptical slice sampling combined with
      a random sparse approximation to the Gaussian process. We demonstrate applications
      of the model to network data and clarify its relation to models in the literature,
      several of which emerge as special cases.

    abstract: 'Bayesian statistical models allow us to formalise our knowledge about
      the world and reason about our uncertainty, but there is a need for better procedures
      to accurately encode its complexity. One way to do so is through compositional
      models, which are formed by combining blocks consisting of simpler models. One
      can increase the complexity of the compositional model by either stacking more
      blocks or by using a not-so-simple model as a building block. This thesis is
      an example of the latter. One first aim is to expand the choice of Bayesian
      nonparametric (BNP) blocks for constructing tractable compositional models.
      So far, most of the models that have a Bayesian nonparametric component use
      a Dirichlet Process or a Pitman-Yor process because of the availability of tractable
      and compact representations. This thesis shows how to overcome certain intractabilities
      in order to obtain analogous compact representations for the class of Poisson-Kingman
      priors which includes the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes. A major impediment
      to the widespread use of Bayesian nonparametric building blocks is that inference
      is often costly, intractable or difficult to carry out. This is an active research
      area since dealing with the model''s infinite dimensional component forbids
      the direct use of standard simulation-based methods. The main contribution of
      this thesis is a variety of inference schemes that tackle this problem: Markov
      chain Monte Carlo and Sequential Monte Carlo methods, which are exact inference
      schemes since they target the true posterior. The contributions of this thesis,
      in a larger context, provide general purpose exact inference schemes in the
      flavour or probabilistic programming: the user is able to choose from a variety
      of models, focusing only on the modelling part. Indeed, if the wide enough class
      of Poisson-Kingman priors is used as one of our blocks, this objective is achieved.'

    abstract: We investigate the class of sigma-stable Poisson-Kingman random probability
      measures (RPMs) in the context of Bayesian nonparametric mixture modeling. This
      is a large class of discrete RPMs, which encompasses most of the popular discrete
      RPMs used in Bayesian nonparametrics, such as the Dirichlet process, Pitman-Yor
      process, the normalized inverse Gaussian process, and the normalized generalized
      Gamma process. We show how certain sampling properties and marginal characterizations
      of sigma-stable Poisson-Kingman RPMs can be usefully exploited for devising
      a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for performing posterior inference
      with a Bayesian nonparametric mixture model. Specifically, we introduce a novel
      and efficient MCMC sampling scheme in an augmented space that has a small number
      of auxiliary variables per iteration. We apply our sampling scheme to a density
      estimation and clustering tasks with unidimensional and multidimensional datasets,
      and compare it against competing MCMC sampling schemes. Supplementary materials
      for this article are available online.

    abstract: 'In the modern age, rankings data is ubiquitous and it is useful for
      a variety of applications such as recommender systems, multi-object tracking
      and preference learning. However, most rankings data encountered in the real
      world is incomplete, which prevents the direct application of existing modelling
      tools for complete rankings. Our contribution is a novel way to extend kernel
      methods for complete rankings to partial rankings, via consistent Monte Carlo
      estimators for Gram matrices: matrices of kernel values between pairs of observations.
      We also present a novel variance reduction scheme based on an antithetic variate
      construction between permutations to obtain an improved estimator for the Mallows
      kernel. The corresponding antithetic kernel estimator has lower variance and
      we demonstrate empirically that it has a better performance in a variety of
      Machine Learning tasks. Both kernel estimators are based on extending kernel
      mean embeddings to the embedding of a set of full rankings consistent with an
      observed partial ranking. They form a computationally tractable alternative
      to previous approaches for partial rankings data. An overview of the existing
      kernels and metrics for permutations is also provided.'

    abstract: Copulas allow to learn marginal distributions separately from the multivariate
      dependence structure (copula) that links them together into a density function.
      Vine factorizations ease the learning of high-dimensional copulas by constructing
      a hierarchy of conditional bivariate copulas. However, to simplify inference,
      it is common to assume that each of these conditional bivariate copulas is independent
      from its conditioning variables. In this paper, we relax this assumption by
      discovering the latent functions that specify the shape of a conditional copula
      given its conditioning variables We learn these functions by following a Bayesian
      approach based on sparse Gaussian processes with expectation propagation for
      scalable, approximate inference. Experiments on real-world datasets show that,
      when modeling all conditional dependencies, we obtain better estimates of the
      underlying copula of the data.

    abstract: A new framework based on the theory of copulas is proposed to address
      semisupervised domain adaptation problems. The presented method factorizes any
      multivariate density into a product of marginal distributions and bivariate
      copula functions. Therefore, changes in each of these factors can be detected
      and corrected to adapt a density model accross different learning domains. Importantly,
      we introduce a novel vine copula model, which allows for this factorization
      in a non-parametric manner. Experimental results on regression problems with
      real-world data illustrate the efficacy of the proposed approach when compared
      to state-of-the-art techniques.

    abstract: Classical techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and
      Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) are ubiquitous in statistics. However,
      these techniques only reveal linear relationships in data. Although nonlinear
      variants of PCA and CCA have been proposed, they are computationally prohibitive
      in the large scale. In a separate strand of recent research, randomized methods
      have been proposed to construct features that help reveal nonlinear patterns
      in data. For basic tasks such as regression or classification, random features
      exhibit little or no loss in performance, while achieving dramatic savings in
      computational requirements. In this paper we leverage randomness to design scalable
      new variants of nonlinear PCA and CCA; our ideas also extend to key multivariate
      analysis tools such as spectral clustering or LDA. We demonstrate our algorithms
      through experiments on real-world data, on which we compare against the state-of-the-art.
      Code in R implementing our methods is provided in the Appendix.

    abstract: 'We study unsupervised learning in a probabilistic generative model
      for occlusion. The model uses two types of latent variables: one indicates which
      objects are present in the image, and the other how they are ordered in depth.
      This depth order then determines how the positions and appearances of the objects
      present, specified in the model parameters, combine to form the image. We show
      that the object parameters can be learnt from an unlabelled set of images in
      which objects occlude one another. Exact maximum-likelihood learning is intractable.
      However, we show that tractable approximations to Expectation Maximization (EM)
      can be found if the training images each contain only a small number of objects
      on average. In numerical experiments it is shown that these approximations recover
      the correct set of object parameters. Experiments on a novel version of the
      bars test using colored bars, and experiments on more realistic data, show that
      the algorithm performs well in extracting the generating causes. Experiments
      based on the standard bars benchmark test for object learning show that the
      algorithm performs well in comparison to other recent component extraction approaches.
      The model and the learning algorithm thus connect research on occlusion with
      the research field of multiple-causes component extraction methods.'

    abstract: Neurons in the neocortex code and compute as part of a locally interconnected
      population. Large-scale multi-electrode recording makes it possible to access
      these population processes empirically by fitting statistical models to unaveraged
      data. What statistical structure best describes the concurrent spiking of cells
      within a local network? We argue that in the cortex, where firing exhibits extensive
      correlations in both time and space and where a typical sample of neurons still
      reflects only a very small fraction of the local population, the most appropriate
      model captures shared variability by a low-dimensional latent process evolving
      with smooth dynamics, rather than by putative direct coupling. We test this
      claim by comparing a latent dynamical model with realistic spiking observations
      to coupled generalised linear spike-response models (GLMs) using cortical recordings.
      We find that the latent dynamical approach outperforms the GLM in terms of goodness-of-
      fit, and reproduces the temporal correlations in the data more accurately. We
      also compare models whose observations models are either derived from a Gaussian
      or point-process models, finding that the non-Gaussian model provides slightly
      better goodness-of-fit and more realistic population spike counts.

    abstract: Predicting the future trajectory of a moving agent can be easy when
      the past trajectory continues smoothly but is challenging when complex interactions
      with other agents are involved. Recent deep learning approaches for trajectory
      prediction show promising performance and partially attribute this to successful
      reasoning about agent-agent interactions. However, it remains unclear which
      features such black-box models actually learn to use for making predictions.
      This paper proposes a procedure that quantifies the contributions of different
      cues to model performance based on a variant of Shapley values. Applying this
      procedure to state-of-the-art trajectory prediction methods on standard benchmark
      datasets shows that they are, in fact, unable to reason about interactions.
      Instead, the past trajectory of the target is the only feature used for predicting
      its future. For a task with richer social interaction patterns, on the other
      hand, the tested models do pick up such interactions to a certain extent, as
      quantified by our feature attribution method. We discuss the limits of the proposed
      method and its links to causality.

    abstract: Policy networks are a central feature of deep reinforcement learning
      (RL) algorithms for continuous control, enabling the estimation and sampling
      of high-value actions. From the variational inference perspective on RL, policy
      networks, when used with entropy or KL regularization, are a form of amortized
      optimization, optimizing network parameters rather than the policy distributions
      directly. However, direct amortized mappings can yield suboptimal policy estimates
      and restricted distributions, limiting performance and exploration. Given this
      perspective, we consider the more flexible class of iterative amortized optimizers.
      We demonstrate that the resulting technique, iterative amortized policy optimization,
      yields performance improvements over direct amortization on benchmark continuous
      control tasks.

    abstract: Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs; Garnelo et al., 2018) are meta-learning
      models which leverage the flexibility of deep learning to produce well-calibrated
      predictions and naturally handle off-the-grid and missing data. CNPs scale to
      large datasets and train with ease. Due to these features, CNPs appear well-suited
      to tasks from environmental sciences or healthcare. Unfortunately, CNPs do not
      produce correlated predictions, making them fundamentally inappropriate for
      many estimation and decision making tasks. Predicting heat waves or floods,
      for example, requires modelling dependencies in temperature or precipitation
      over time and space. Existing approaches which model output dependencies, such
      as Neural Processes (NPs; Garnelo et al., 2018b) or the FullConvGNP (Bruinsma
      et al., 2021), are either complicated to train or prohibitively expensive. What
      is needed is an approach which provides dependent predictions, but is simple
      to train and computationally tractable. In this work, we present a new class
      of Neural Process models that make correlated predictions and support exact
      maximum likelihood training that is simple and scalable. We extend the proposed
      models by using invertible output transformations, to capture non-Gaussian output
      distributions. Our models can be used in downstream estimation tasks which require
      dependent function samples. By accounting for output dependencies, our models
      show improved predictive performance on a range of experiments with synthetic
      and real data.

    abstract: Object recognition has made great advances in the last decade, but predominately
      still relies on many high-quality training examples per object category. In
      contrast, learning new objects from only a few examples could enable many impactful
      applications from robotics to user personalization. Most few-shot learning research,
      however, has been driven by benchmark datasets that lack the high variation
      that these applications will face when deployed in the real-world. To close
      this gap, we present the ORBIT dataset and benchmark, grounded in the real-world
      application of teachable object recognizers for people who are blind/low-vision.
      The dataset contains 3,822 videos of 486 objects recorded by people who are
      blind/low-vision on their mobile phones. The benchmark reflects a realistic,
      highly challenging recognition problem, providing a rich playground to drive
      research in robustness to few-shot, high-variation conditions. We set the benchmark's
      first state-of-the-art and show there is massive scope for further innovation,
      holding the potential to impact a broad range of real-world vision applications
      including tools for the blind/low-vision community.

    abstract: McCullagh and Yang (2006) suggest a family of classification algorithms
      based on Cox processes. We further investigate the log Gaussian variant which
      has a number of appealing properties. Conditioned on the covariates, the distribution
      over labels is given by a type of conditional Markov random field. In the supervised
      case, computation of the predictive probability of a single test point scales
      linearly with the number of training points and the multiclass generalization
      is straightforward. We show new links between the supervised method and classical
      nonparametric methods. We give a detailed analysis of the pairwise graph representable
      Markov random field, which we use to extend the model to semi-supervised learning
      problems, and propose an inference method based on graph min-cuts. We give the
      first experimental analysis on supervised and semi-supervised datasets and show
      good empirical performance.

    abstract: The variational framework for learning inducing variables (Titsias,
      2009a) has had a large impact on the Gaussian process literature. The framework
      may be interpreted as minimizing a rigorously defined Kullback-Leibler divergence
      between the approximating and posterior processes. To our knowledge this connection
      has thus far gone unremarked in the literature. In this paper we give a substantial
      generalization of the literature on this topic. We give a new proof of the result
      for infinite index sets which allows inducing points that are not data points
      and likelihoods that depend on all function values. We then discuss augmented
      index sets and show that, contrary to previous works, marginal consistency of
      augmentation is not enough to guarantee consistency of variational inference
      with the original model. We then characterize an extra condition where such
      a guarantee is obtainable. Finally we show how our framework sheds light on
      interdomain sparse approximations and sparse approximations for Cox processes.

    abstract: Whilst deep neural networks have shown great empirical success, there
      is still much work to be done to understand their theoretical properties. In
      this paper, we study the relationship between random, wide, fully connected,
      feedforward networks with more than one hidden layer and Gaussian processes
      with a recursive kernel definition. We show that, under broad conditions, as
      we make the architecture increasingly wide, the implied random function converges
      in distribution to a Gaussian process, formalising and extending existing results
      by Neal (1996) to deep networks. To evaluate convergence rates empirically,
      we use maximum mean discrepancy. We then compare finite Bayesian deep networks
      from the literature to Gaussian processes in terms of the key predictive quantities
      of interest, finding that in some cases the agreement can be very close. We
      discuss the desirability of Gaussian process behaviour and review non-Gaussian
      alternative models from the literature.

    abstract: In modern machine learning it is common to train models which have an
      extremely high intrinsic capacity. The results obtained are often i nitialization
      dependent, are different for disparate optimizers and in some cases have no
      explicit regularization. This raises difficult questions about generalization.
      A natural approach to questions of generalization is a Bayesian one. There is
      therefore a growing literature attempting to understand how Bayesian posterior
      inference could emerge from the complexity of modern practice, even without
      having such a procedure as the stated goal. In this work we consider a simple
      special case where exact Bayesian posterior sampling emerges from sampling (cf
      initialization) and then gradient descent. Specifically, for a Bayesian linear
      model, if we parameterize it in terms of a deterministic function of an isotropic
      normal prior, then the action of sampling from the prior followed by first order
      optimization of the squared loss will give a posterior sample. Although the
      assumptions are stronger than many real problems, it still exhibits the challenging
      properties of redundant model capacity and a lack of explicit regularizers,
      along with initialization and optimizer dependence. It is therefore an interesting
      controlled test case. Given its simplicity, the method itself may turn out to
      be of independent interest from our original goal.

    abstract: 'Applications to learn control of unfamiliar dynamical systems with
      increasing autonomy are ubiquitous. From robotics, to finance, to industrial
      processing, autonomous learning helps obviate a heavy reliance on experts for
      system identification and controller design. Often real world systems are nonlinear,
      stochastic, and expensive to operate (e.g. slow, energy intensive, prone to
      wear and tear). Ideally therefore, nonlinear systems can be identified with
      minimal system interaction. This thesis considers data efficient autonomous
      learning of control of nonlinear, stochastic systems. Data efficient learning
      critically requires probabilistic modelling of dynamics. Traditional control
      approaches use deterministic models, which easily overfit data, especially small
      datasets. We use probabilistic Bayesian modelling to learn systems from scratch,
      similar to the PILCO algorithm, which achieved unprecedented data efficiency
      in learning control of several benchmarks. We extend PILCO in three principle
      ways. First, we learn control under significant observation noise by simulating
      a filtered control process using a tractably analytic framework of Gaussian
      distributions. In addition, we develop the `latent variable belief Markov decision
      process'' when filters must predict under real-time constraints. Second, we
      improve PILCO''s data efficiency by directing exploration with predictive loss
      uncertainty and Bayesian optimisation, including a novel approximation to the
      Gittins index. Third, we take a step towards data efficient learning of high-dimensional
      control using Bayesian neural networks (BNN). Experimentally we show although
      filtering mitigates adverse effects of observation noise, much greater performance
      is achieved when optimising controllers with evaluations faithful to reality:
      by simulating closed-loop filtered control if executing closed-loop filtered
      control. Thus, controllers are optimised w.r.t. how they are used, outperforming
      filters applied to systems optimised by unfiltered simulations. We show directed
      exploration improves data efficiency. Lastly, we show BNN dynamics models are
      almost as data efficient as Gaussian process models. Results show data efficient
      learning of high-dimensional control is possible as BNNs scale to high-dimensional
      state inputs.'

    abstract: 'Autonomous vehicle (AV) software is typically composed of a pipeline
      of individual components, linking sensor inputs to motor outputs. Erroneous
      component outputs propagate downstream, hence safe AV software must consider
      the ultimate effect of each component''s errors. Further, improving safety alone
      is not sufficient. Passengers must also feel safe to trust and use AV systems.
      To address such concerns, we investigate three under-explored themes for AV
      research: safety, interpretability, and compliance. Safety can be improved by
      quantifying the uncertainties of component outputs and propagating them forward
      through the pipeline. Interpretability is concerned with explaining what the
      AV observes and why it makes the decisions it does, building reassurance with
      the passenger. Compliance refers to maintaining some control for the passenger.
      We discuss open challenges for research within these themes. We highlight the
      need for concrete evaluation metrics, propose example problems, and highlight
      possible solutions.'

    abstract: We present a data-efficient reinforcement learning method for continuous
      state-action systems under significant observation noise. Data-efficient solutions
      under small noise exist, such as PILCO which learns the cartpole swing-up task
      in 30s. PILCO evaluates policies by planning state-trajectories using a dynamics
      model. However, PILCO applies policies to the observed state, therefore planning
      in observation space. We extend PILCO with filtering to instead plan in belief
      space, consistent with partially observable Markov decisions process (POMDP)
      planning. This enables data-efficient learning under significant observation
      noise, outperforming more naive methods such as post-hoc application of a filter
      to policies optimised by the original (unfiltered) PILCO algorithm. We test
      our method on the cartpole swing-up task, which involves nonlinear dynamics
      and requires nonlinear control.

    abstract: In many scientific disciplines it is often required to make predictions
      about how a system will behave or to deduce the correct control values to elicit
      a particular desired response. Efficiently solving both of these tasks relies
      on the construction of a model capturing the system's operation. In the most
      interesting situations, the model needs to capture strongly nonlinear effects
      and deal with the presence of uncertainty and noise. Building models for such
      systems purely based on a theoretical understanding of underlying physical principles
      can be infeasibly complex and require a large number of simplifying assumptions.
      An alternative is to use a data-driven approach, which builds a model directly
      from observations. A powerful and principled approach to doing this is to use
      a Gaussian Process (GP).<br> In this thesis we start by discussing how GPs can
      be applied to data sets which have noise affecting their inputs. We present
      the "Noisy Input GP", which uses a simple local-linearisation to refer the input
      noise into heteroscedastic output noise, and compare it to other methods both
      theoretically and empirically. We show that this technique leads to a effective
      model for nonlinear functions with input and output noise. We then consider
      the broad topic of GP state space models for application to dynamical systems.
      We discuss a very wide variety of approaches for using GPs in state space models,
      including introducing a new method based on moment-matching, which consistently
      gave the best performance. We analyse the methods in some detail including providing
      a systematic comparison between approximate-analytic and particle methods. To
      our knowledge such a comparison has not been provided before in this area. Finally,
      we investigate an automatic control learning framework, which uses Gaussian
      Processes to model a system for which we wish to design a controller. Controller
      design for complex systems is a difficult task and thus a framework which allows
      an automatic design directly from data promises to be extremely useful. We demonstrate
      that the previously published framework cannot cope with the presence of observation
      noise but that the introduction of a state space model dramatically improves
      its performance. This contribution, along with some other suggested improvements
      opens the door for this framework to be used in real-world applications.

    abstract: In standard Gaussian Process regression input locations are assumed
      to be noise free. We present a simple yet effective GP model for training on
      input points corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise. To make computations tractable
      we use a local linear expansion about each input point. This allows the input
      noise to be recast as output noise proportional to the squared gradient of the
      GP posterior mean. The input noise hyperparameters are trained alongside other
      hyperparameters by the usual method of maximisation of the marginal likelihood,
      and allow estimation of the noise levels on each input dimension. Training uses
      an iterative scheme, which alternates between optimising the hyperparameters
      and calculating the posterior gradient. Analytic predictive moments can then
      be found for Gaussian distributed test points. We compare our model to others
      over a range of different regression problems and show that it improves over
      current methods.

    abstract: We introduce binary matrix factorization, a novel model for unsupervised
      matrix decomposition. The decomposition is learned by fitting a non-parametric
      Bayesian probabilistic model with binary latent variables to a matrix of dyadic
      data. Unlike bi-clustering models, which assign each row or column to a single
      cluster based on a categorical hidden feature, our binary feature model reflects
      the prior belief that items and attributes can be associated with more than
      one latent cluster at a time. We provide simple learning and inference rules
      for this new model and show how to extend it to an infinite model in which the
      number of features is not a priori fixed but is allowed to grow with the size
      of the data.

    abstract: The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies has revolutionized
      the way we study genomes and gene regulation. In a single experiment, millions
      of reads are produced. To gain knowledge from these experiments the first thing
      to be done is finding the genomic origin of the reads, i.e., mapping the reads
      to a reference genome. In this new situation, conventional alignment tools are
      obsolete, as they cannot handle this huge amount of data in a reasonable amount
      of time. Thus, new mapping algorithms have been developed, which are fast at
      the expense of a small decrease in accuracy. In this chapter we discuss the
      current problems in short read mapping and show that mapping reads correctly
      is a nontrivial task. Through simple experiments with both real and synthetic
      data, we demonstrate that different mappers can give different results depending
      on the type of data, and that a considerable fraction of uniquely mapped reads
      is potentially mapped to an incorrect location. Furthermore, we provide simple
      statistical results on the expected number of random matches in a genome (E-value)
      and the probability of a random match as a function of read length. Finally,
      we show that quality scores contain valuable information for mapping and why
      mapping quality should be evaluated in a probabilistic manner. In the end, we
      discuss the potential of improving the performance of current methods by considering
      these quality scores in a probabilistic mapping program.

    abstract: 'Factor analysis and related models for probabilistic matrix factorisation
      are of central importance to the unsupervised analysis of data, with a colourful
      history more than a century long. Probabilistic models for matrix factorisation
      allow us to explore the underlying structure in data, and have relevance in
      a vast number of application areas including collaborative filtering, source
      separation, missing data imputation, gene expression analysis, information retrieval,
      computational finance and computer vision, amongst others.<br> This thesis develops
      generalisations of matrix factorisation models that advance our understanding
      and enhance the applicability of this important class of models. The generalisation
      of models for matrix factorisation focuses on three concerns: widening the applicability
      of latent variable models to the diverse types of data that are currently available;
      considering alternative structural forms in the underlying representations that
      are inferred; and including higher order data structures into the matrix factorisation
      framework. These three issues reflect the reality of modern data analysis and
      we develop new models that allow for a principled exploration and use of data
      in these settings. We place emphasis on Bayesian approaches to learning and
      the advantages that come with the Bayesian methodology. Our port of departure
      is a generalisation of latent variable models to members of the exponential
      family of distributions. This generalisation allows for the analysis of data
      that may be real-valued, binary, counts, non-negative or a heterogeneous set
      of these data types. The model unifies various existing models and constructs
      for unsupervised settings, the complementary framework to the generalised linear
      models in regression.<br> Moving to structural considerations, we develop Bayesian
      methods for learning sparse latent representations. We define ideas of weakly
      and strongly sparse vectors and investigate the classes of prior distributions
      that give rise to these forms of sparsity, namely the scale-mixture of Gaussians
      and the spike-and-slab distribution. Based on these sparsity favouring priors,
      we develop and compare methods for sparse matrix factorisation and present the
      first comparison of these sparse learning approaches. As a second structural
      consideration, we develop models with the ability to generate correlated binary
      vectors. Moment-matching is used to allow binary data with specified correlation
      to be generated, based on dichotomisation of the Gaussian distribution. We then
      develop a novel and simple method for binary PCA based on Gaussian dichotomisation.
      The third generalisation considers the extension of matrix factorisation models
      to multi-dimensional arrays of data that are increasingly prevalent. We develop
      the first Bayesian model for non-negative tensor factorisation and explore the
      relationship between this model and the previously described models for matrix
      factorisation.'

    abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has become established as one of
      the key tools for dimensionality reduction when dealing with real valued data.
      Approaches such as exponential family PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation
      have successfully extended PCA to non-Gaussian data types, but these techniques
      fail to take advantage of Bayesian inference and can suffer from problems of
      overfitting and poor generalisation. This paper presents a fully probabilistic
      approach to PCA, which is generalised to the exponential family, based on Hybrid
      Monte Carlo sampling. We describe the model which is based on a factorisation
      of the observed data matrix, and show performance of the model on both synthetic
      and real data.

    abstract: The use of L1 regularisation for sparse learning has generated immense
      research interest, with many successful applications in diverse areas such as
      signal acquisition, image coding, genomics and collaborative filtering. While
      existing work highlights the many advantages of L1 methods, in this paper we
      find that L1 regularisation often dramatically under-performs in terms of predictive
      performance when compared to other methods for inferring sparsity. We focus
      on unsupervised latent variable models, and develop L1 minimising factor models,
      Bayesian variants of "L1", and Bayesian models with a stronger L0-like sparsity
      induced through spike-and-slab distributions. These spike-and-slab Bayesian
      factor models encourage sparsity while accounting for uncertainty in a principled
      manner, and avoid unnecessary shrinkage of non-zero values. We demonstrate on
      a number of data sets that in practice spike-and-slab Bayesian methods out-perform
      L1 minimisation, even on a com- putational budget. We thus highlight the need
      to re-assess the wide use of L1 methods in sparsity-reliant applications, particularly
      when we care about generalising to previously unseen data, and provide an alternative
      that, over many varying conditions, provides improved generalisation performance.

    abstract: Sparse Gaussian Processes are a key component of high-throughput Bayesian
      optimisation (BO) loops — an increasingly common setting where evaluation budgets
      are large and highly parallelised. By using representative subsets of the available
      data to build approximate posteriors, sparse models dramatically reduce the
      computational costs of surrogate modelling by relying on a small set of pseudo-observations,
      the so-called inducing points, in lieu of the full data set. However, current
      approaches to design inducing points are not appropriate within BO loops as
      they seek to reduce global uncertainty in the objective function. Thus, the
      high-fidelity modelling of promising and data-dense regions required for precise
      optimisation is sacrificed and computational resources are instead wasted on
      modelling areas of the space already known to be sub-optimal. Inspired by entropy-based
      BO methods, we propose a novel inducing point design that uses a principled
      information-theoretic criterion to select inducing points. By choosing inducing
      points to maximally reduce both global uncertainty and uncertainty in the maximum
      value of the objective function, we build surrogate models able to support high-precision
      high-throughput BO.

      genes. A consistent profile of gene expression changes in end- stage cardiomyopathy
      led us to hypothesise that distinct global patterns of the epigenome may also
      exist. Methods and Results. We constructed genome-wide maps of DNA methylation
      and Histone-3 Lysine-36 tri-methylation (H3K36me3)-enrichment for cardiomyopathic
      and normal human hearts. 506Mb of sequence per library was generated by high-throughput
      sequencing, covering 24 million out of the 28 million CG di-nucleotides in the
      human genome. DNA methylation was significantly different in promoter CpG-islands
      (CGI), intra-genic CGI, gene bodies and H3K36me3-enriched regions of the genome.
      Moreover DNA methylation differences were present in promoters of upregulated
      genes but not down-regulated genes. The profile of H3K36me3-enrichment itself
      was also significantly different in protein-coding regions of the genome. Conclusions.
      Distinct epigenomic patterns exist in important DNA elements of the human cardiac
      genome in end-stage cardiomyopathy. If epigenomic patterns track with disease
      progression, assays for the epigenome may be more useful than quantification
      of mRNA for assessing prognosis in heart failure. These results open up an important
      new horizon of research and further studies will be needed to determine how
      epigenomics contribute to altered gene expression in cardiomyopathy.

    abstract: Farquhar et al. [2021] show that correcting for active learning bias
      with underparameterised models leads to improved downstream performance. For
      overparameterised models such as NNs, however, correction leads either to decreased
      or unchanged performance. They suggest that this is due to an "overfitting bias"
      which offsets the active learning bias. We show that depth uncertainty networks
      operate in a low overfitting regime, much like underparameterised models. They
      should therefore see an increase in performance with bias correction. Surprisingly,
      they do not. We propose that this negative result, as well as the results Farquhar
      et al. [2021], can be explained via the lens of the bias-variance decomposition
      of generalisation error.

    abstract: Bayesian learning in undirected graphical models|computing posterior
      distributions over parameters and predictive quantities is exceptionally difficult.
      We conjecture that for general undirected models, there are no tractable MCMC
      (Markov Chain Monte Carlo) schemes giving the correct equilibrium distribution
      over parameters. While this intractability, due to the partition function, is
      familiar to those performing parameter optimisation, Bayesian learning of posterior
      distributions over undirected model parameters has been unexplored and poses
      novel challenges. we propose several approximate MCMC schemes and test on fully
      observed binary models (Boltzmann machines) for a small coronary heart disease
      data set and larger artificial systems. While approximations must perform well
      on the model, their interaction with the sampling scheme is also important.
      Samplers based on variational mean- field approximations generally performed
      poorly, more advanced methods using loopy propagation, brief sampling and stochastic
      dynamics lead to acceptable parameter posteriors. Finally, we demonstrate these
      techniques on a Markov random field with hidden variables.

    abstract: 'Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms are routinely used to draw
      samples from distributions with intractable normalization constants. However,
      standard MCMC algorithms do not apply to doubly-intractable distributions in
      which there are additional parameter-dependent normalization terms; for example,
      the posterior over parameters of an undirected graphical model. An ingenious
      auxiliary-variable scheme (Møller et al., 2004) offers a solution: exact sampling
      (Propp and Wilson, 1996) is used to sample from a Metropolis–Hastings proposal
      for which the acceptance probability is tractable. Unfortunately the acceptance
      probability of these expensive updates can be low. This paper provides a generalization
      of Møller et al. (2004) and a new MCMC algorithm, which obtains better acceptance
      probabilities for the same amount of exact sampling, and removes the need to
      estimate model parameters before sampling begins.'

    abstract: Dropout regularization of deep neural networks has been a mysterious
      yet effective tool to prevent overfitting. Explanations for its success range
      from the prevention of co-adapted weights to it being a form of cheap Bayesian
      inference. We propose a novel framework for understanding multiplicative noise
      in neural networks, considering continuous distributions as well as Bernoulli
      noise (i.e. dropout). We show that multiplicative noise induces structured shrinkage
      priors on a network's weights. We derive the equivalence through reparametrization
      properties of scale mixtures and without invoking any approximations. Given
      the equivalence, we then show that dropout's Monte Carlo training objective
      approximates marginal MAP estimation. We leverage these insights to propose
      a novel shrinkage framework for resnets, terming the prior 'automatic depth
      determination' as it is the natural analog of automatic relevance determination
      for network depth. Lastly, we investigate two inference strategies that improve
      upon the aforementioned MAP approximation in regression benchmarks.

    abstract: Circular variables arise in a multitude of data-modelling contexts ranging
      from robotics to the social sciences, but they have been largely overlooked
      by the machine learning community. This paper partially redresses this imbalance
      by extending some standard probabilistic modelling tools to the circular domain.
      First we introduce a new multivariate distribution over circular variables,
      called the multivariate Generalised von Mises (mGvM) distribution. This distribution
      can be constructed by restricting and renormalising a general multivariate Gaussian
      distribution to the unit hyper-torus. Previously proposed multivariate circular
      distributions are shown to be special cases of this construction. Second, we
      introduce a new probabilistic model for circular regression, that is inspired
      by Gaussian Processes, and a method for probabilistic principal component analysis
      with circular hidden variables. These models can leverage standard modelling
      tools (e.g. covariance functions and methods for automatic relevance determination).
      Third, we show that the posterior distribution in these models is a mGvM distribution
      which enables development of an efficient variational free-energy scheme for
      performing approximate inference and approximate maximum-likelihood learning.

      The relationships between several approaches are elucidated theoretically, and

    abstract: Density modeling is notoriously difficult for high dimensional data.
      One approach to the problem is to search for a lower dimensional manifold which
      captures the main characteristics of the data. Recently, the Gaussian Process
      Latent Variable Model (GPLVM) has successfully been used to find low dimensional
      manifolds in a variety of complex data. The GPLVM consists of a set of points
      in a low dimensional latent space, and a stochastic map to the observed space.
      We show how it can be interpreted as a density model in the observed space.
      However, the GPLVM is not trained as a density model and therefore yields bad
      density estimates. We propose a new training strategy and obtain improved generalisation
      performance and better density estimates in comparative evaluations on several
      benchmark data sets.

    abstract: Most clustering algorithms produce a single clustering solution. This
      is inadequate for many data sets that are multi-faceted and can be grouped and
      interpreted in many different ways. Moreover, for high-dimensional data, different
      features may be relevant or irrelevant to each clustering solution, suggesting
      the need for feature selection in clustering. Features relevant to one clustering
      interpretation may be different from the ones relevant for an alternative interpretation
      or view of the data. In this paper, we introduce a probabilistic nonparametric
      Bayesian model that can discover multiple clustering solutions from data and
      the feature subsets that are relevant for the clusters in each view. In our
      model, the features in different views may be shared and therefore the sets
      of relevant features are allowed to overlap. We model feature relevance to each
      view using an Indian Buffet Process and the cluster membership in each view
      using a Chinese Restaurant Process. We provide an inference approach to learn
      the latent parameters corresponding to this multiple partitioning problem. Our
      model not only learns the features and clusters in each view but also automatically
      learns the number of clusters, number of views and number of features in each
      view.

    abstract: There is a previously identified equivalence between wide fully connected
      neural networks (FCNs) and Gaussian processes (GPs). This equivalence enables,
      for instance, test set predictions that would have resulted from a fully Bayesian,
      infinitely wide trained FCN to be computed without ever instantiating the FCN,
      but by instead evaluating the corresponding GP. In this work, we derive an analogous
      equivalence for multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) both with and
      without pooling layers, and achieve state of the art results on CIFAR10 for
      GPs without trainable kernels. We also introduce a Monte Carlo method to estimate
      the GP corresponding to a given neural network architecture, even in cases where
      the analytic form has too many terms to be computationally feasible. Surprisingly,
      in the absence of pooling layers, the GPs corresponding to CNNs with and without
      weight sharing are identical. As a consequence, translation equivariance, beneficial
      in finite channel CNNs trained with stochastic gradient descent (SGD), is guaranteed
      to play no role in the Bayesian treatment of the infinite channel limit—a qualitative
      difference between the two regimes that is not present in the FCN case. We confirm
      experimentally, that while in some scenarios the performance of SGD-trained
      finite CNNs approaches that of the corresponding GPs as the channel count increases,
      with careful tuning SGD-trained CNNs can significantly outperform their corresponding
      GPs, suggesting advantages from SGD training compared to fully Bayesian parameter
      estimation.

    abstract: We consider the optimal approximate posterior over the top-layer weights
      in a Bayesian neural network for regression, and show that it exhibits strong
      dependencies on the lower-layer weights. We adapt this result to develop a correlated
      approximate posterior over the weights at all layers in a Bayesian neural network.
      We extend this approach to deep Gaussian processes, unifying inference in the
      two model classes. Our approximate posterior uses learned “global” inducing
      points, which are defined only at the input layer and propagated through the
      network to obtain inducing inputs at subsequent layers. By contrast, standard
      “local”, inducing point methods from the deep Gaussian process literature optimise
      a separate set of inducing inputs at every layer, and thus do not model correlations
      across layers. Our method gives state-of-the-art performance for a variational
      Bayesian method, without data augmentation or tempering, on CIFAR-10 of 86.7

    abstract: Recent work introduced deep kernel processes as an entirely kernel-based
      alternative to NNs (Aitchison et al. 2020). Deep kernel processes flexibly learn
      good top-layer representations by alternately sampling the kernel from a distribution
      over positive semi-definite matrices and performing nonlinear transformations.
      A particular deep kernel process, the deep Wishart process (DWP), is of particular
      interest because its prior can be made equivalent to deep Gaussian process (DGP)
      priors for kernels that can be expressed entirely in terms of Gram matrices.
      However, inference in DWPs has not yet been possible due to the lack of sufficiently
      flexible distributions over positive semi-definite matrices. Here, we give a
      novel approach to obtaining flexible distributions over positive semi-definite
      matrices by generalising the Bartlett decomposition of the Wishart probability
      density. We use this new distribution to develop an approximate posterior for
      the DWP that includes dependency across layers. We develop a doubly-stochastic
      inducing-point inference scheme for the DWP and show experimentally that inference
      in the DWP can improve performance over doing inference in a DGP with the equivalent
      prior.

    abstract: The neural linear model is a simple adaptive Bayesian linear regression
      method that has recently been used in a number of problems ranging from Bayesian
      optimization to reinforcement learning. Despite its apparent successes in these
      settings, to the best of our knowledge there has been no systematic exploration
      of its capabilities on simple regression tasks. In this work we characterize
      these on the UCI datasets, a popular benchmark for Bayesian regression models,
      as well as on the recently introduced UCI “gap” datasets, which are better tests
      of out-of-distribution uncertainty. We demonstrate that the neural linear model
      is a simple method that shows generally good performance on these tasks, but
      at the cost of requiring good hyperparameter tuning.

    abstract: Deep kernel learning (DKL) and related techniques aim to combine the
      representational power of neural networks with the reliable uncertainty estimates
      of Gaussian processes. One crucial aspect of these models is an expectation
      that, because they are treated as Gaussian process models optimized using the
      marginal likelihood, they are protected from overfitting. However, we identify
      situations where this is not the case. We explore this behavior, explain its
      origins and consider how it applies to real datasets. Through careful experimentation
      on the UCI, CIFAR-10, and the UTKFace datasets, we find that the overfitting
      from overparameterized maximum marginal likelihood, in which the model is "somewhat
      Bayesian", can in certain scenarios be worse than that from not being Bayesian
      at all. We explain how and when DKL can still be successful by investigating
      optimization dynamics. We also find that failures of DKL can be rectified by
      a fully Bayesian treatment, which leads to the desired performance improvements
      over standard neural networks and Gaussian processes.

    abstract: This paper examines the robustness of deployed few-shot meta-learning
      systems when they are fed an imperceptibly perturbed few-shot dataset, showing
      that the resulting predictions on test inputs can become worse than chance.
      This is achieved by developing a novel attack, Adversarial Support Poisoning
      or ASP, which crafts a poisoned set of examples. When even a small subset of
      malicious data points is inserted into the support set of a meta-learner, accuracy
      is significantly reduced. We evaluate the new attack on a variety of few-shot
      classification algorithms and scenarios, and propose a form of adversarial training
      that significantly improves robustness against both poisoning and evasion attacks.

      amortized meta-learners, which allows us to craft colluding sets of inputs that

      worse than chance. However, in opposition to the well-known transferability
      of adversarial examples in general, the colluding sets do not transfer well
      to different classifiers. We explore two hypotheses to explain this: ''overfitting''
      by the attack, and mismatch between the model on which the attack is generated

    abstract: We consider the general problem of constructing nonparametric Bayesian
      models on infinite-dimensional random objects, such as functions, infinite graphs
      or infinite permutations. The problem has generated much interest in machine
      learning, where it is treated heuristically, but has not been studied in full
      generality in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, which tends to focus on models
      over probability distributions. Our approach applies a standard tool of stochastic
      process theory, the construction of stochastic processes from their finite-dimensional
      marginal distributions. The main contribution of the paper is a generalization
      of the classic Kolmogorov extension theorem to conditional probabilities. This
      extension allows a rigorous construction of nonparametric Bayesian models from
      systems of finitedimensional, parametric Bayes equations. Using this approach,
      we show (i) how existence of a conjugate posterior for the nonparametric model
      can be guaranteed by choosing conjugate finite-dimensional models in the construction,
      (ii) how the mapping to the posterior parameters of the nonparametric model
      can be explicitly determined, and (iii) that the construction of conjugate models
      in essence requires the finite-dimensional models to be in the exponential family.
      As an application of our constructive framework, we derive a model on infinite
      permutations, the nonparametric Bayesian analogue of a model recently proposed
      for the analysis of rank data.

    abstract: A pivotal problem in Bayesian nonparametrics is the construction of
      prior distributions on the space M(V) of probability measures on a given domain
      V. In principle, such distributions on the infinite-dimensional space M(V) can
      be constructed from their finite-dimensional marginals—the most prominent example
      being the construction of the Dirichlet process from finite-dimensional Dirichlet
      distributions. This approach is both intuitive and applicable to the construction
      of arbitrary distributions on M(V), but also hamstrung by a number of technical
      difficulties. We show how these difficulties can be resolved if the domain V
      is a Polish topological space, and give a representation theorem directly applicable
      to the construction of any probability distribution on M(V) whose first moment
      measure is well-defined. The proof draws on a projective limit theorem of Bochner,
      and on properties of set functions on Polish spaces to establish countable additivity
      of the resulting random probabilities.

    abstract: 'The aim of this thesis is to present a mathematical framework for conceptualizing
      and constructing adaptive autonomous systems under resource constraints. The
      first part of this thesis contains a concise presentation of the foundations
      of classical agency: namely the formalizations of decision making and learning.
      Decision making includes: (a) subjective expected utility (SEU) theory, the
      framework of decision making under uncertainty; (b) the maximum SEU principle
      to choose the optimal solution; and (c) its application to the design of autonomous
      systems, culminating in the Bellman optimality equations. Learning includes:
      (a) Bayesian probability theory, the theory for reasoning under uncertainty
      that extends logic; and (b) Bayes-Optimal agents, the application of Bayesian
      probability theory to the design of optimal adaptive agents. Then, two major
      problems of the maximum SEU principle are highlighted: (a) the prohibitive computational
      costs and (b) the need for the causal precedence of the choice of the policy.
      The second part of this thesis tackles the two aforementioned problems. First,
      an information-theoretic notion of resources in autonomous systems is established.
      Second, a framework for resource-bounded agency is introduced. This includes:
      (a) a maximum bounded SEU principle that is derived from a set of axioms of
      utility; (b) an axiomatic model of probabilistic causality, which is applied
      for the formalization of autonomous systems having uncertainty over their policy
      and environment; and (c) the Bayesian control rule, which is derived from the
      maximum bounded SEU principle and the model of causality, implementing a stochastic
      adaptive control law that deals with the case where autonomous agents are uncertain
      about their policy and environment.'

    abstract: Rewards typically express desirabilities or preferences over a set of
      alternatives. Here we propose that rewards can be defined for any probability
      distribution based on three desiderata, namely that rewards should be real-
      valued, additive and order-preserving, where the later implies that more probable
      events should also be more desirable. Our main result states that rewards are
      then uniquely determined by the negative information content. To analyze stochastic
      processes, we define the utility of a realization as its reward rate. Under
      this interpretation, we show that the expected utility of a stochastic process
      is its negative entropy rate. Furthermore, we apply our results to analyze agent-environment
      interactions. We show that the expected utility that will actually be achieved
      by the agent is given by the negative cross-entropy from the input-output (I/O)
      distribution of the coupled interaction system and the agent's I/O distribution.
      Thus, our results allow for an information-theoretic interpretation of the notion
      of utility and the characterization of agent-environment interactions in terms
      of entropy dynamics.

    abstract: Explaining adaptive behavior is a central problem in artificial intelligence
      research. Here we formalize adaptive agents as mixture distributions over sequences
      of inputs and outputs (I/O). Each distribution of the mixture constitutes a
      "possible world", but the agent does not know which of the possible worlds it
      is actually facing. The problem is to adapt the I/O stream in a way that is
      compatible with the true world. A natural measure of adaptation can be obtained
      by the Kullback Leibler (KL) divergence between the I/O distribution of the
      true world and the I/O distribution expected by the agent that is uncertain
      about possible worlds. In the case of pure input streams, the Bayesian mixture
      provides a well-known solution for this problem. We show, however, that in the
      case of I/O streams this solution breaks down, because outputs are issued by
      the agent itself and require a different probabilistic syntax as provided by
      intervention calculus. Based on this calculus, we obtain a Bayesian control
      rule that allows modeling adaptive behavior with mixture distributions over
      I/O streams. This rule might allow for a novel approach to adaptive control
      based on a minimum KL-principle.

    abstract: This paper proposes a method to construct an adaptive agent that is
      univemacmacrsal with respect to a given class of experts, where each expert
      is designed specifically for a particular environment. This adaptive control
      problem is formalized as the problem of minimizing the relative entropy of the
      adaptive agent from the expert that is most suitable for the unknown environment.
      If the agent is a passive observer, then the optimal solution is the well-known
      Bayesian predictor. However, if the agent is active, then its past actions need
      to be treated as causal interventions on the I/O stream rather than normal probability
      conditions. Here it is shown that the solution to this new variational problem
      is given by a stochastic controller called the Bayesian control rule, which
      implements adaptive behavior as a mixture of experts. Furthermore, it is shown
      that under mild assumptions, the Bayesian control rule converges to the control
      law of the most suitable expert.

    abstract: 'Classic decision-theory is based on the maximum expected utility (MEU)
      principle, but crucially ignores the resource costs incurred when determining
      optimal decisions. Here we propose an axiomatic framework for bounded decision-making
      that considers resource costs. Agents are formalized as probability measures
      over input-output streams. We postulate that any such probability measure can
      be assigned a corresponding conjugate utility function based on three axioms:
      utilities should be real-valued, additive and monotonic mappings of probabilities.
      We show that these axioms enforce a unique conversion law between utility and
      probability (and thereby, information). Moreover, we show that this relation
      can be characterized as a variational principle: given a utility function, its
      conjugate probability measure maximizes a free utility functional. Transformations
      of probability measures can then be formalized as a change in free utility due
      to the addition of new constraints expressed by a target utility function. Accordingly,
      one obtains a criterion to choose a probability measure that trades off the
      maximization of a target utility function and the cost of the deviation from
      a reference distribution. We show that optimal control, adaptive estimation
      and adaptive control problems can be solved this way in a resource-efficient
      way. When resource costs are ignored, the MEU principle is recovered. Our formalization
      might thus provide a principled approach to bounded rationality that establishes
      a close link to information theory.'

    abstract: Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially
      ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we
      employ an axiomatic framework for bounded rational decision-making based on
      a thermodynamic interpretation of resource costs as information costs. This
      leads to a variational free utility principle akin to thermodynamical free energy
      that trades off utility and information costs. We show that bounded optimal
      control solutions can be derived from this variational principle, which leads
      in general to stochastic policies. Furthermore, we show that risk-sensitive
      and robust (minimax) control schemes fall out naturally from this framework
      if the environment is considered as a bounded rational and perfectly rational
      opponent, respectively. When resource costs are ignored, the maximum expected
      utility principle is recovered.

      principles are preserved: predictive probabilities are well-calibrated, uncertainties
      on out-of-distribution data are improved, and continual-learning performance
      is boosted. This work enables practical deep learning while preserving benefits
      of Bayesian principles. A PyTorch implementation is available as a plug-and-play

    abstract: Numerical integration is a key component of many problems in scientiﬁc
      computing, statistical modelling, and machine learning. Bayesian Quadrature
      is a model-based method for numerical integration which, relative to standard
      Monte Carlo methods, offers increased sample efficiency and a more robust estimate
      of the uncertainty in the estimated integral. We propose a novel Bayesian Quadrature
      approach for numerical integration when the integrand is non-negative, such
      as the case of computing the marginal likelihood, predictive distribution, or
      normalising constant of a probabilistic model. Our approach approximately marginalises
      the quadrature model’s hyperparameters in closed form, and introduces an active
      learning scheme to optimally select function evaluations, as opposed to using
      Monte Carlo samples. We demonstrate our method on both a number of synthetic
      benchmarks and a real scientiﬁc problem from astronomy.

    abstract: 1. The UK Government’s draft ‘Algorithmic Transparency Standard’ is
      intended to provide a standardised way for public bodies and government departments
      to provide information about how algorithmic tools are being used to support
      decisions. The research discussed in this report was conducted in parallel to
      the piloting of the Standard by the Cabinet Office and the Centre for Data Ethics
      and Innovation. 2. We conducted semi-structured interviews with respondents
      from across UK policing and commercial bodies involved in policing technologies.
      Our aim was to explore the implications for police forces of participation in
      the Standard, to identify rewards, risks, challenges for the police, and areas
      where the Standard could be improved, and therefore to contribute to the exploration
      of policy options for expansion of participation in the Standard. 3. Algorithmic
      transparency is both achievable for policing and could bring significant rewards.
      A key reward of police participation in the Standard is that it provides the
      opportunity to demonstrate proficient implementation of technology-driven policing,
      thus enhancing earned trust. Research participants highlighted the public good
      that could result from the considered use of algorithms. 4. Participants noted,
      however, a risk of misperception of the dangers of policing technology, especially
      if use of algorithmic tools was not appropriately compared to the status quo
      and current methods. 5. Participation in the Standard provides an opportunity
      to develop increased sharing among police forces of best practices (and things
      to avoid), and increased thoughtfulness among police force personnel in building
      and implementing new tools. Research participants were keen for compliance with
      the Standard to become an integral part of a holistic system to drive reflective
      practice across policing around the development and deployment of algorithmic
      technology. This could enable police to learn from each other, facilitate good
      policy choices and decrease wasted costs. Otherwise, the Standard may come to
      be regarded as an administrative burden rather than a benefit for policing.
      6. Several key areas for amendment and improvement from the perspective of policing
      were identified in the research. These could improve the Standard for the benefit
      of all participants. These include a need for clarification of the scope of
      the Standard, and the stage of project development at which the Standard should
      apply. It is recommended that consideration be given to a ‘Standard-Lite’ for
      projects at the pilot or early stages of the development process in order to
      gain public understanding of new tools and applications. Furthermore, the Standard
      would benefit from a more substantial glossary (to include relevant policing
      terms) and additional guidance on the level of detail required in each section
      and how accuracy rates should be described, justified and explained in order
      to ensure consistency. 7. The research does not suggest any overriding reason
      why the Standard should not be applied in policing. Suitable exemptions for
      sensitive contexts and tradecraft would be required, however, and consideration
      given to ensuring that forces have the resources to comply with the Standard
      and to respond to the increased public interest that could ensue. Limiting the
      scope initially to tools on a defined list (to include the most high-risk tools,
      such as those that produce individualised risk/predictive scores) could assist
      in mitigating concerns over sensitive policing capabilities and resourcing.
      A non-public version of the Standard for sensitive applications and tools could
      also be considered, which would be available to bodies with an independent oversight
      function. 8. To support police compliance with the Standard, supplier responsibilities
      – including appropriate disclosure of algorithmic functionality, data inputs
      and performance – should be covered in procurement contracts and addressed up
      front as a mandatory requirement of doing business with the police. 9. As well
      as contributing to the piloting of the Standard, it is recommended that the
      findings of this report are considered at NPCC level, by the College of Policing
      and by the office of the Chief Scientific Advisor for Policing, as new sector-led
      guidance, best practice and policy are developed.

    abstract: Latent variable models for network data extract a summary of the relational
      structure underlying an observed network. The simplest possible models subdivide
      nodes of the network into clusters; the probability of a link between any two
      nodes then depends only on their cluster assignment. Currently available models
      can be classified by whether clusters are disjoint or are allowed to overlap.
      These models can explain a "flat" clustering structure. Hierarchical Bayesian
      models provide a natural approach to capture more complex dependencies. We propose
      a model in which objects are characterised by a latent feature vector. Each
      feature is itself partitioned into disjoint groups (subclusters), corresponding
      to a second layer of hierarchy. In experimental comparisons, the model achieves
      significantly improved predictive performance on social and biological link
      prediction tasks. The results indicate that models with a single layer hierarchy
      over-simplify real networks.

    abstract: We present a nonparametric prior over reversible Markov chains. We use
      completely random measures, specifically gamma processes, to construct a countably
      infinite graph with weighted edges. By enforcing symmetry to make the edges
      undirected we define a prior over random walks on graphs that results in a reversible
      Markov chain. The resulting prior over infinite transition matrices is closely
      related to the hierarchical Dirichlet process but enforces reversibility. A
      reinforcement scheme has recently been proposed with similar properties, but
      the de Finetti measure is not well characterised. We take the alternative approach
      of explicitly constructing the mixing measure, which allows more straightforward
      and efficient inference at the cost of no longer having a closed form predictive
      distribution. We use our process to construct a reversible infinite HMM which
      we apply to two real datasets, one from epigenomics and one ion channel recording.

    abstract: Factor analysis models effectively summarise the covariance structure
      of high dimensional data, but the solutions are typically hard to interpret.
      This motivates attempting to find a disjoint partition, i.e. a simple clustering,
      of observed variables into highly correlated subsets. We introduce a Bayesian
      non-parametric approach to this problem, and demonstrate advantages over heuristic
      methods proposed to date. Our Dirichlet process variable clustering (DPVC) model
      can discover block-diagonal covariance structures in data. We evaluate our method
      on both synthetic and gene expression analysis problems.

    abstract: Statistical learning relies upon data sampled from a distribution, and
      we usually do not care what actually generated it in the first place. From the
      point of view of causal modeling, the structure of each distribution is induced
      by physical mechanisms that give rise to dependences between observables. Mechanisms,
      however, can be meaningful autonomous modules of generative models that make
      sense beyond a particular entailed data distribution, lending themselves to
      transfer between problems. We develop an algorithm to recover a set of independent
      (inverse) mechanisms from a set of transformed data points. The approach is
      unsupervised and based on a set of experts that compete for data generated by
      the mechanisms, driving specialization. We analyze the proposed method in a
      series of experiments on image data. Each expert learns to map a subset of the
      transformed data back to a reference distribution. The learned mechanisms generalize
      to novel domains. We discuss implications for transfer learning and links to
      recent trends in generative modeling.

    abstract: Previously, the exploding gradient problem has been explained to be
      central in deep learning and model-based reinforcement learning, because it
      causes numerical issues and instability in optimization. Our experiments in
      model-based reinforcement learning imply that the problem is not just a numerical
      issue, but it may be caused by a fundamental chaos-like nature of long chains
      of nonlinear computations. Not only do the magnitudes of the gradients become
      large, the direction of the gradients becomes essentially random. We show that
      reparameterization gradients suffer from the problem, while likelihood ratio
      gradients are robust. Using our insights, we develop a model-based policy search
      framework, Probabilistic Inference for Particle-Based Policy Search (PIPPS),
      which is easily extensible, and allows for almost arbitrary models and policies,
      while simultaneously matching the performance of previous data-efficient learning
      algorithms. Finally, we invent the total propagation algorithm, which efficiently
      computes a union over all pathwise derivative depths during a single backwards
      pass, automatically giving greater weight to estimators with lower variance,
      sometimes improving over reparameterization gradients by 10<sup>6</sup> times.

    abstract: Probabilistic circuits (PCs) are a promising avenue for probabilistic
      modeling, as they permit a wide range of exact and efficient inference routines.
      Recent “deep-learning-style” implementations of PCs strive for a better scalability,
      but are still difficult to train on real-world data, due to their sparsely connected
      computational graphs. In this paper, we propose Einsum Networks (EiNets), a
      novel implementation design for PCs, improving prior art in several regards.
      At their core, EiNets combine a large number of arithmetic operations in a single
      monolithic einsum-operation, leading to speedups and memory savings of up to
      two orders of magnitude, in comparison to previous implementations. As an algorithmic
      contribution, we show that the implementation of Expectation-Maximization (EM)
      can be simplified for PCs, by leveraging automatic differentiation. Furthermore,
      we demonstrate that EiNets scale well to datasets which were previously out
      of reach, such as SVHN and CelebA, and that they can be used as faithful generative
      image models.

    abstract: In this chapter we propose a modification of CRF-like algorithms that
      allows for solving large-scale structured classification problems. Our approach
      consists in upper bounding the CRF functional in order to decompose its training
      into independent optimisation problems per clique. Furthermore we show that
      each sub-problem corresponds to solving a multiclass learning task in each clique,
      which enlarges the applicability of these tools for large-scale structural learning
      problems. Before presenting the Conditional Graphical Model (CGM), as we refer
      to this procedure, we review the family of CRF algorithms. We concentrate on
      the best known procedures and standard generalisations of CRFs. The ob jective
      of this introduction is analysing from the same viewpoint the proposed solutions
      in the literature to tackle this problem, which allows comparing their different
      features. We complete the chapter with a case study, in which we show the possibility
      to work with large-scale problems using CGM and that the obtained performance
      is comparable to the result with CRF-like algorithms.

    abstract: Machine learning approaches commonly rely on the assumption of independent
      and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data. In reality, however, this assumption
      is almost always violated due to distribution shifts between environments. Although
      valuable learning signals can be provided by heterogeneous data from changing
      distributions, it is also known that learning under arbitrary (adversarial)
      changes is impossible. Causality provides a useful framework for modeling distribution
      shifts, since causal models encode both observational and interventional distributions.
      In this work, we explore the sparse mechanism shift hypothesis, which posits
      that distribution shifts occur due to a small number of changing causal conditionals.
      Motivated by this idea, we apply it to learning causal structure from heterogeneous
      environments, where i.i.d. data only allows for learning an equivalence class
      of graphs without restrictive assumptions. We propose the Mechanism Shift Score
      (MSS), a score-based approach amenable to various empirical estimators, which
      provably identifies the entire causal structure with high probability if the
      sparse mechanism shift hypothesis holds. Empirically, we verify behavior predicted
      by the theory and compare multiple estimators and score functions to identify
      the best approaches in practice. Compared to other methods, we show how MSS
      bridges a gap by both being nonparametric as well as explicitly leveraging sparse
      changes.

    abstract: Simultaneous recordings of many neurons embedded within a recurrently-connected
      cortical network may provide concurrent views into the dynamical processes of
      that network, and thus its computational function. In principle, these dynamics
      might be identified by purely unsupervised, statistical means. Here, we show
      that a Hidden Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (HSLDS) model - in which multiple
      linear dynamical laws approximate and nonlinear and potentially non-stationary
      dynamical process - is able to distinguish dynamical regimes within single-trial
      motor cortical activity associated with the preparation and initiation of hand
      movements. The regimes are identified without reference to behavioural or experimental
      epochs, but nonetheless transitions between them correlate strongly with external
      events whose timing may vary from trial to trial. The HSLDS model also performs
      better than recent comparable models in predicting the firing rate of an isolated
      neuron based on the firing rates of others, suggesting that it captures more
      of the "Shared variance" of the data. Thus, the method is able to trace the
      dynamical processes underlying the coordinated evolution of network activity
      in a way that appears to reflect its computational role.

    abstract: Fluctuations are inherent to any fabrication process. Integrated circuits
      and microelectromechanical systems are particularly affected by these variations,
      and due to high-quality requirements the effect on the devices' perform ance
      has to be understood quantitatively. In recent years, it has become possible
      to model the performance of such complex systems on the basis of design specifications,
      and model-based sensitivity analysis has made its way into industrial engineering.
      We show how an efficient Bayesian approach, using a Gaussian process prior,
      can replace the commonly used brute-force Monte Carlo scheme, making it possible
      to apply the analysis to computationally costly models. We introduce a number
      of global, statistically justified sensitivity measures for design analysis
      and optimization. Two models of integrated systems serve us as case studies
      to introduce the analysis and to assess its convergence properties. We show
      that the Bayesian Monte Carlo scheme can save costly simulation runs and can
      ensure a reliable accuracy of the analysis.

    abstract: Score-based generative modelling (SGM) has proven to be a very effective
      method for modelling densities on finite-dimensional spaces. In this work we
      propose to extend this methodology to learn generative models over functional
      spaces. To do so, we represent functional data in spectral space to dissociate
      the stochastic part of the processes from their space-time part. Using dimensionality
      reduction techniques we then sample from their stochastic component using finite
      dimensional SGM. We demonstrate our method's effectiveness for modelling various
      multimodal datasets.

    abstract: While reinforcement learning has led to promising results in robotics,
      defining an informative reward function is challenging. Prior work considered
      including the human in the loop to jointly learn the reward function and the
      optimal policy. Generating samples from a physical robot and requesting human
      feedback are both taxing efforts for which efficiency is critical. We propose
      to learn reward functions from both the robot and the human perspectives to
      improve on both efficiency metrics. Learning a reward function from the human
      perspective increases feedback efficiency by assuming that humans rank trajectories
      according to a low-dimensional outcome space. Learning a reward function from
      the robot perspective circumvents the need for a dynamics model while retaining
      the sample efficiency of model-based approaches. We provide an algorithm that
      incorporates bi-perspective reward learning into a general hierarchical reinforcement
      learning framework and demonstrate the merits of our approach on a toy task
      and a simulated robot grasping task.

    abstract: Leveraging the wealth of unlabeled data produced in recent years provides
      great potential for improving supervised models. When the cost of acquiring
      labels is high, probabilistic active learning methods can be used to greedily
      select the most informative data points to be labeled. However, for many large-scale
      problems standard greedy procedures become computationally infeasible and suffer
      from negligible model change. In this paper, we introduce a novel Bayesian batch
      active learning approach that mitigates these issues. Our approach is motivated
      by approximating the complete data posterior of the model parameters. While
      naive batch construction methods result in correlated queries, our algorithm
      produces diverse batches that enable efficient active learning at scale. We
      derive interpretable closed-form solutions akin to existing active learning
      procedures for linear models, and generalize to arbitrary models using random
      projections. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach on several large-scale
      regression and classification tasks.

      task contexts. Contextual policy search offers data-efficient learning and generalization
      by explicitly conditioning the policy on a parametric context space. In this
      paper, we further structure the contextual policy representation. We propose
      to factor contexts into two components: target contexts that describe the task
      objectives, e.g. target position for throwing a ball; and environment contexts
      that characterize the environment, e.g. initial position or mass of the ball.
      Our key observation is that experience can be directly generalized over target
      contexts. We show that this can be easily exploited in contextual policy search
      algorithms. In particular, we apply factorization to a Bayesian optimization
      approach to contextual policy search both in sampling-based and active learning
      settings. Our simulation results show faster learning and better generalization
      in various robotic domains. See our supplementary video: https://youtu.be/MNTbBAOufDY.'

    abstract: The paper presents a new copula based method for measuring dependence
      between random variables. Our approach extends the Maximum Mean Discrepancy
      to the copula of the joint distribution. We prove that this approach has several
      advantageous properties. Similarly to Shannon mutual information, the proposed
      dependence measure is invariant to any strictly increasing transformation of
      the marginal variables. This is important in many applications, for example
      in feature selection. The estimator is consistent, robust to outliers, and uses
      rank statistics only. We derive upper bounds on the convergence rate and propose
      independence tests too. We illustrate the theoretical contributions through
      a series of experiments in feature selection and low-dimensional embedding of
      distributions.

    abstract: 'Model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has been proven to be a powerful,
      general tool for learning complex behaviors. However, its sample efficiency
      is often impractically large for solving challenging real-world problems, even
      for off-policy algorithms such as Q-learning. A limiting factor in classic model-free
      RL is that the learning signal consists only of scalar rewards, ignoring much
      of the rich information contained in state transition tuples. Model-based RL
      uses this information, by training a predictive model, but often does not achieve
      the same asymptotic performance as model-free RL due to model bias. We introduce
      temporal difference models (TDMs), a family of goal-conditioned value functions
      that can be trained with model-free learning and used for model-based control.
      TDMs combine the benefits of model-free and model-based RL: they leverage the
      rich information in state transitions to learn very efficiently, while still
      attaining asymptotic performance that exceeds that of direct model-based RL
      methods. Our experimental results show that, on a range of continuous control
      tasks, TDMs provide a substantial improvement in efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
      model-based and model-free methods.'

    abstract: In many real-world classification problems the input contains a large
      number of potentially irrelevant features. This paper proposes a new Bayesian
      framework for determining the relevance of input features. This approach extends
      one of the most successful Bayesian methods for feature selection and sparse
      learning, known as Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD). ARD finds the relevance
      of features by optimizing the model marginal likelihood, also known as the evidence.
      We show that this can lead to overfitting. To address this problem, we propose
      Predictive ARD based on estimating the predictive performance of the classifier.
      While the actual leave-one-out predictive performance is generally very costly
      to compute, the expectation propagation (EP) algorithm proposed by Minka provides
      an estimate of this predictive performance as a side-effect of its iterations.
      We exploit this in our algorithm to do feature selection, and to select data
      points in a sparse Bayesian kernel classifier. Moreover, we provide two other
      improvements to previous algorithms, by replacing Laplace's approximation with
      the generally more accurate EP, and by incorporating the fast optimization algorithm
      proposed by Faul and Tipping. Our experiments show that our method based on
      the EP estimate of predictive performance is more accurate on test data than
      relevance determination by optimizing the evidence.

    abstract: 'When searching for characteristic subpatterns in potentially noisy
      graph data, it appears self-evident that having multiple observations would
      be better than having just one. However, it turns out that the inconsistencies
      introduced when different graph instances have different edge sets pose a serious
      challenge. In this work we address this challenge for the problem of finding
      maximum weighted cliques. We introduce the concept of most persistent soft-clique.
      This is subset of vertices, that 1) is almost fully or at least densely connected,
      2) occurs in all or almost all graph instances, and 3) has the maximum weight.
      We present a measure of clique-ness, that essentially counts the number of edge
      missing to make a subset of vertices into a clique. With this measure, we show
      that the problem of finding the most persistent soft-clique problem can be cast
      either as: a) a max-min two person game optimization problem, or b) a min-min
      soft margin optimization problem. Both formulations lead to the same solution
      when using a partial Lagrangian method to solve the optimization problems. By
      experiments on synthetic data and on real social network data we show that the
      proposed method is able to reliably find soft cliques in graph data, even if
      that is distorted by random noise or unreliable observations.'

    abstract: We propose a probabilistic model to infer supervised latent variables
      in the Hamming space from observed data. Our model allows simultaneous inference
      of the number of binary latent variables, and their values. The latent variables
      preserve neighbourhood structure of the data in a sense that objects in the
      same semantic concept have similar latent values, and objects in different concepts
      have dissimilar latent values. We formulate the supervised infinite latent variable
      problem based on an intuitive principle of pulling objects together if they
      are of the same type, and pushing them apart if they are not. We then combine
      this principle with a flexible Indian Buffet Process prior on the latent variables.
      We show that the inferred supervised latent variables can be directly used to
      perform a nearest neighbour search for the purpose of retrieval. We introduce
      a new application of dynamically extending hash codes, and show how to effectively
      couple the structure of the hash codes with continuously growing structure of
      the neighbourhood preserving infinite latent feature space.

      It also allows for a clear theoretically justified ranking of the closeness

      directly to designs of new better sparse approximations, combining the best
      of the existing strategies, within attractive computational constraints.

    abstract: 'While there is strong motivation for using Gaussian Processes (GPs)
      due to their excellent performance in regression and classification problems,
      their computational complexity makes them impractical when the size of the training
      set exceeds a few thousand cases. This has motivated the recent proliferation
      of a number of cost-effective approximations to GPs, both for classification
      and for regression. In this paper we analyze one popular approximation to GPs
      for regression: the reduced rank approximation. While generally GPs are equivalent
      to infinite linear models, we show that Reduced Rank Gaussian Processes (RRGPs)
      are equivalent to finite sparse linear models. We also introduce the concept
      of degenerate GPs and show that they correspond to inappropriate priors. We
      show how to modify the RRGP to prevent it from being degenerate at test time.
      Training RRGPs consists both in learning the covariance function hyperparameters
      and the support set. We propose a method for learning hyperparameters for a
      given support set. We also review the Sparse Greedy GP (SGGP) approximation
      (Somla and Bartlett, 2001), which is a way of learning the support set for given
      hyperparameters based on approximating the posterior. We propose an alternative
      method to the SGGP that has better generalization capabilities. Finally we make
      experiments to compare the different ways of training a RRGP. We provide some
      Matlab code for learning RRGPs.'

    abstract: 'Recently, multinomial inverse regression (MNIR) has been proposed as
      a new model of annotated text based on the influence of metadata and response
      variables on the distribution of words in a document. While effective, MNIR
      has no way to exploit structure in the corpus to improve its predictions or
      facilitate exploratory data analysis. On the other hand, traditional probabilistic
      topic models (like latent Dirichlet allocation) capture natural heterogeneity
      in a collection but do not account for external variables. In this paper, we
      introduce the inverse regression topic model (IRTM), a mixed-membership extension
      of MNIR that combines the strengths of both methodologies. We present two inference
      algorithms for the IRTM: an efficient batch estimation algorithm and an online
      variant, which is suitable for large corpora. We apply these methods to a corpus
      of 73K Congressional press releases and another of 150K Yelp reviews, demonstrating
      that the IRTM outperforms both MNIR and supervised topic models on the prediction
      task. Further, we give examples showing that the IRTM enables systematic discovery
      of in-topic lexical variation, which is not possible with previous supervised
      topic models.'

    abstract: Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) is often the method of choice for computing
      Bayesian integrals that are not analytically tractable. However the success
      of this method may require a very large number of evaluations of the (un-normalized)
      posterior and its partial derivatives. In situations where the posterior is
      computationally costly to evaluate, this may lead to an unacceptable computational
      load for HMC. I propose to use a Gaussian Process model of the (log of the)
      posterior for most of the computations required by HMC. Within this scheme only
      occasional evaluation of the actual posterior is required to guarantee that
      the samples generated have exactly the desired distribution, even if the GP
      model is somewhat inaccurate. The method is demonstrated on a 10 dimensional
      problem, where 200 evaluations suffice for the generation of 100 roughly independent
      points from the posterior. Thus, the proposed scheme allows Bayesian treatment
      of models with posteriors that are computationally demanding, such as models
      involving computer simulation.

    abstract: We give a basic introduction to Gaussian Process regression models.
      We focus on understanding the role of the stochastic process and how it is used
      to define a distribution over functions. We present the simple equations for
      incorporating training data and examine how to learn the hyperparameters using
      the marginal likelihood. We explain the practical advantages of Gaussian Process
      and end with conclusions and a look at the current trends in GP work.

    abstract: This thesis develops two Bayesian learning methods relying on Gaussian
      processes and a rigorous statistical approach for evaluating such methods. In
      these experimental designs the sources of uncertainty in the estimated generalisation
      performances due to both variation in training and test sets are accounted for.
      The framework allows for estimation of generalisation performance as well as
      statistical tests of significance for pairwise comparisons. Two experimental
      designs are recommended and supported by the DELVE software environment.<br>
      Two new non-parametric Bayesian learning methods relying on Gaussian process
      priors over functions are developed. These priors are controlled by hyperparameters
      which set the characteristic length scale for each input dimension. In the simplest
      method, these parameters are fit from the data using optimization. In the second,
      fully Bayesian method, a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique is used to integrate
      over the hyperparameters. One advantage of these Gaussian process methods is
      that the priors and hyperparameters of the trained models are easy to interpret.<br>
      The Gaussian process methods are benchmarked against several other methods,
      on regression tasks using both real data and data generated from realistic simulations.
      The experiments show that small datasets are unsuitable for benchmarking purposes
      because the uncertainties in performance measurements are large. A second set
      of experiments provide strong evidence that the bagging procedure is advantageous
      for the Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) method.<br> The simulated
      datasets have controlled characteristics which make them useful for understanding
      the relationship between properties of the dataset and the performance of different
      methods. The dependency of the performance on available computation time is
      also investigated. It is shown that a Bayesian approach to learning in multi-layer
      perceptron neural networks achieves better performance than the commonly used
      early stopping procedure, even for reasonably short amounts of computation time.
      The Gaussian process methods are shown to consistently outperform the more conventional
      methods.

    abstract: Although the use of clustering methods has rapidly become one of the
      standard computational approaches in the literature of microarray gene expression
      data, little attention has been paid to uncertainty in the results obtained.
      Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) models provide a nonparametric Bayesian alternative
      to the bootstrap approach to modeling uncertainty in gene expression clustering.
      Most previously published applications of Bayesian model-based clustering methods
      have been to short time series data. In this paper, we present a case study
      of the application of nonparametric Bayesian clustering methods to the clustering
      of high-dimensional nontime series gene expression data using full Gaussian
      covariances. We use the probability that two genes belong to the same cluster
      in a DPM model as a measure of the similarity of these gene expression profiles.
      Conversely, this probability can be used to define a dissimilarity measure,
      which, for the purposes of visualization, can be input to one of the standard
      linkage algorithms used for hierarchical clustering. Biologically plausible
      results are obtained from the Rosetta compendium of expression profiles which
      extend previously published cluster analyses of this data.

    abstract: We provide a novel framework for very fast model-based reinforcement
      learning in continuous state and action spaces. The framework requires probabilistic
      models that explicitly characterize their levels of confidence. Within this
      framework, we use flexible, non-parametric models to describe the world based
      on previously collected experience. We demonstrate learning on the cart-pole
      problem in a setting where we provide very limited prior knowledge about the
      task. Learning progresses rapidly, and a good policy is found after only a hand-full
      of iterations.

    abstract: The Bayesian paradigm apparently only sometimes gives rise to Occam's
      Razor; at other times very large models perform well. We give simple examples
      of both kinds of behaviour. The two views are reconciled when measuring complexity
      of functions, rather than of the machinery used to implement them. We analyze
      the complexity of functions for some linear in the parameter models that are
      equivalent to Gaussian Processes, and always find Occam's Razor at work.

    abstract: We present an extension to the Mixture of Experts (ME) model, where
      the individual experts are Gaussian Process (GP) regression models. Using an
      input-dependent adaptation of the Dirichlet Process, we implement a gating network
      for an infinite number of Experts. Inference in this model may be done efficiently
      using a Markov Chain relying on Gibbs sampling. The model allows the effective
      covariance function to vary with the inputs, and may handle large datasets —
      thus potentially overcoming two of the biggest hurdles with GP models. Simulations
      show the viability of this approach.

    abstract: We investigate Bayesian alternatives to classical Monte Carlo methods
      for evaluating integrals. Bayesian Monte Carlo (BMC) allows the incorporation
      of prior knowledge, such as smoothness of the integrand, into the estimation.
      In a simple problem we show that this outperforms any classical importance sampling
      method. We also attempt more challenging multidimensional integrals involved
      in computing marginal likelihoods of statistical models (a.k.a. partition functions
      and model evidences). We find that Bayesian Monte Carlo outperformed Annealed
      Importance Sampling, although for very high dimensional problems or problems
      with massive multimodality BMC may be less adequate. One advantage of the Bayesian
      approach to Monte Carlo is that samples can be drawn from any distribution.
      This allows for the possibility of active design of sample points so as to maximise
      information gain.

    abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression
      models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time.
      We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed
      form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem
      with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic
      ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow
      the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely
      their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement
      learning.

      Finally, a range of inference methods is provided, including exact and variational

    abstract: The Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) is a sparse approximate Bayesian
      kernel method. It provides full predictive distributions for test cases. However,
      the predictive uncertainties have the unintuitive property, that they get smaller
      the further you move away from the training cases. We give a thorough analysis.
      Inspired by the analogy to non-degenerate Gaussian Processes, we suggest augmentation
      to solve the problem. The purpose of the resulting model, RVM*, is primarily
      to corroborate the theoretical and experimental analysis. Although RVM* could
      be used in practical applications, it is no longer a truly sparse model. Experiments
      show that sparsity comes at the expense of worse predictive distributions.

    abstract: In the establishment of connections between nerve and muscle there is
      an initial stage when each muscle fibre is innervated by several different motor
      axons. Withdrawal of connections then takes place until each fibre has contact
      from just a single axon. The evidence suggests that the withdrawal process involves
      competition between nerve terminals. We examine in formal models several types
      of competitive mechanism that have been proposed for this phenomenon. We show
      that a model which combines competition for a presynaptic resource with competition
      for a postsynaptic resource is superior to others. This model accounts for many
      anatomical and physiological findings and has a biologically plausible implementation.
      Intrinsic withdrawal appears to be a side effect of the competitive mechanism
      rather than a separate non-competitive feature. The model's capabilities are
      confirmed by theoretical analysis and full scale computer simulations.

    abstract: 'Motivation: The Bayesian network approach is a framework which combines
      graphical representation and probability theory, which includes, as a special
      case, hidden Markov models. Hidden Markov models trained on amino acid sequence
      or secondary structure data alone have been shown to have potential for addressing
      the problem of protein fold and superfamily classification. Results: This paper
      describes a novel implementation of a Bayesian network which simultaneously
      learns amino acid sequence, secondary structure and residue accessibility for
      proteins of known three-dimensional structure. An awareness of the errors inherent
      in predicted secondary structure may be incorporated into the model by means
      of a confusion matrix. Training and validation data have been derived for a
      number of protein superfamilies from the Structural Classification of Proteins
      (SCOP) database. Cross validation results using posterior probability classification
      demonstrate that the Bayesian network performs better in classifying proteins
      of known structural superfamily than a hidden Markov model trained on amino
      acid sequences alone.'

    abstract: Machine unlearning refers to the task of removing a subset of training
      data, thereby removing its contributions to a trained model. Approximate unlearning
      are one class of methods for this task which avoid the need to retrain the model
      from scratch on the retained data. Bayes’ rule can be used to cast approximate
      unlearning as an inference problem where the objective is to obtain the updated
      posterior by dividing out the likelihood of deleted data. However this has its
      own set of challenges as one often doesn’t have access to the exact posterior
      of the model parameters. In this work we examine the use of the Laplace approximation
      and Variational Inference to obtain the updated posterior. With a neural network
      trained for a regression task as the guiding example, we draw insights on the
      applicability of Bayesian unlearning in practical scenarios.

    abstract: Inference for latent feature models is inherently difficult as the inference
      space grows exponentially with the size of the input data and number of latent
      features. In this work, we use Kurihara     Welling (2008)'s maximization-expectation
      framework to perform approximate MAP inference for linear-Gaussian latent feature
      models with an Indian Buffet Process (IBP) prior. This formulation yields a
      submodular function of the features that corresponds to a lower bound on the
      model evidence. By adding a constant to this function, we obtain a nonnegative
      submodular function that can be maximized via a greedy algorithm that obtains
      at least a one-third approximation to the optimal solution. Our inference method
      scales linearly with the size of the input data, and we show the efficacy of
      our method on the largest datasets currently analyzed using an IBP model.

    abstract: 'Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are a popular framework for modeling
      complex data distributions; they can be efficiently trained via variational
      inference by maximizing the evidence lower bound (ELBO), at the expense of a
      gap to the exact (log-)marginal likelihood. While VAEs are commonly used for
      representation learning, it is unclear why ELBO maximization would yield useful
      representations, since unregularized maximum likelihood estimation cannot invert
      the data-generating process. Yet, VAEs often succeed at this task. We seek to
      elucidate this apparent paradox by studying nonlinear VAEs in the limit of near-deterministic
      decoders. We first prove that, in this regime, the optimal encoder approximately
      inverts the decoder – a commonly used but unproven conjecture – which we refer
      to as self-consistency. Leveraging self-consistency, we show that the ELBO converges
      to a regularized log-likelihood. This allows VAEs to perform what has recently
      been termed independent mechanism analysis (IMA): it adds an inductive bias
      towards decoders with column-orthogonal Jacobians, which helps recovering the
      true latent factors. The gap between ELBO and log-likelihood is therefore welcome,
      since it bears unanticipated benefits for nonlinear representation learning.
      In experiments on synthetic and image data, we show that VAEs uncover the true
      latent factors when the data generating process satisfies the IMA assumption.'

    abstract: The goal of this paper is to design image classification systems that,
      after an initial multi-task training phase, can automatically adapt to new tasks
      encountered at test time. We introduce a conditional neural process based approach
      to the multi-task classification setting for this purpose, and establish connections
      to the meta- and few-shot learning literature. The resulting approach, called
      CNAPs, comprises a classifier whose parameters are modulated by an adaptation
      network that takes the current task's dataset as input. We demonstrate that
      CNAPs achieves state-of-the-art results on the challenging Meta-Dataset benchmark
      indicating high-quality transfer-learning. We show that the approach is robust,
      avoiding both over-fitting in low-shot regimes and under-fitting in high-shot
      regimes. Timing experiments reveal that CNAPs is computationally efficient at
      test-time as it does not involve gradient based adaptation. Finally, we show
      that trained models are immediately deployable to continual learning and active
      learning where they can outperform existing approaches that do not leverage
      transfer learning.

    abstract: 'Multi-output regression models must exploit dependencies between outputs
      to maximise predictive performance. The application of Gaussian processes (GPs)
      to this setting typically yields models that are computationally demanding and
      have limited representational power. We present the Gaussian Process Autoregressive
      Regression (GPAR) model, a scalable multi-output GP model that is able to capture
      nonlinear, possibly input-varying, dependencies between outputs in a simple
      and tractable way: the product rule is used to decompose the joint distribution
      over the outputs into a set of conditionals, each of which is modelled by a
      standard GP. GPAR’s efficacy is demonstrated on a variety of synthetic and real-world

    abstract: 'From training data from several related domains (or tasks), methods
      of domain adaptation try to combine knowledge to improve performance. This paper
      discusses an approach to domain adaptation which is inspired by a causal interpretation
      of the multi-task problem. We assume that a covariate shift assumption holds
      true for a subset of predictor variables: the conditional of the target variable
      given this subset of predictors is invariant with respect to shifts in those
      predictors (covariates). We propose to learn the corresponding conditional expectation
      in the training domains and use it for estimation in the target domain. We further
      introduce a method which allows for automatic inference of the above subset
      in regression and classification. We study the performance of this approach
      in an adversarial setting, in the case where no additional examples are available
      in the test domain. If a labeled sample is available, we provide a method for
      using both the transferred invariant conditional and task specific information.
      We present results on synthetic data sets and a sentiment analysis problem.'

    abstract: Distributional approaches to value-based reinforcement learning model
      the entire distribution of returns, rather than just their expected values,
      and have recently been shown to yield state-of-the-art empirical performance.
      This was demonstrated by the recently proposed C51 algorithm, based on categorical
      distributional reinforcement learning (CDRL) [Bellemare et al., 2017]. However,
      the theoretical properties of CDRL algorithms are not yet well understood. In
      this paper, we introduce a framework to analyse CDRL algorithms, establish the
      importance of the projected distributional Bellman operator in distributional
      RL, draw fundamental connections between CDRL and the Cramér distance, and give
      a proof of convergence for sample-based categorical distributional reinforcement
      learning algorithms.

      We show fundamental connections to optimal transport theory, leading to novel
      sampling algorithms, and providing new theoretical grounding for existing strategies.
      We compare our new strategies against prior methods for improving sample efficiency,

    abstract: Factor analysis, principal component analysis, mixtures of gaussian
      clusters, vector quantization, Kalman filter models, and hidden Markov models
      can all be unified as variations of unsupervised learning under a single basic
      generative model. This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations
      and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking
      discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the
      use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also
      a variation of the same basic generative model. We show that factor analysis
      and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks
      and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce
      a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis,
      as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also
      review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic
      models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.

    abstract: Linear programming (LP) relaxations are a popular method to attempt
      to find a most likely configuration of a discrete graphical model. If a solution
      to the relaxed problem is obtained at an integral vertex then the solution is
      guaranteed to be exact and we say that the relaxation is tight. We consider
      binary pairwise models and introduce new methods which allow us to demonstrate
      refined conditions for tightness of LP relaxations in the Sherali-Adams hierarchy.
      Our results include showing that for higher order LP relaxations, treewidth
      is not precisely the right way to characterize tightness. This work is primarily
      theoretical, with insights that can improve efficiency in practice.

    abstract: The idea of uprooting and rerooting graphical models was introduced
      specifically for binary pairwise models by Weller [18] as a way to transform
      a model to any of a whole equivalence class of related models, such that inference
      on any one model yields inference results for all others. This is very helpful
      since inference, or relevant bounds, may be much easier to obtain or more accurate
      for some model in the class. Here we introduce methods to extend the approach
      to models with higher-order potentials and develop theoretical insights. For
      example, we demonstrate that the triplet-consistent polytope TRI is unique in
      being 'universally rooted'. We demonstrate empirically that rerooting can significantly
      improve accuracy of methods of inference for higher-order models at negligible
      computational cost.

    abstract: If we consider the claim made by some cognitive scientists that the
      mind performs Bayesian reasoning, and if we simultaneously accept the Physical
      Church-Turing thesis and thus believe that the computational power of the mind
      is no more than that of a Turing machine, then what limitations are there to
      the reasoning abilities of the mind? I give an overview of joint work with Nathanael
      Ackerman (Harvard, Mathematics) and Cameron Freer (MIT, CSAIL) that bears on
      the computability and complexity of Bayesian reasoning. In particular, we prove
      that conditional probability is in general not computable in the presence of
      continuous random variables. However, in light of additional structure in the
      prior distribution, such as the presence of certain types of noise, or of exchangeability,
      conditioning is possible. These results cover most of statistical practice.
      At the workshop on Logic and Computational Complexity, we presented results
      on the computational complexity of conditioning, embedding sharp-P-complete
      problems in the task of computing conditional probabilities for diffuse continuous
      random variables. This work complements older work. For example, under cryptographic
      assumptions, the computational complexity of producing samples and computing
      probabilities was separated by Ben-David, Chor, Goldreich and Luby. In recent
      work, we also make use of cryptographic assumptions to show that different representations
      of exchangeable sequences may have vastly different complexity. However, when
      faced with an adversary that is computational bounded, these different representations
      have the same complexity, highlighting the fact that knowledge representation
      and approximation play a fundamental role in the possibility and plausibility
      of Bayesian reasoning.

    abstract: The generic inference and learning algorithm for Gaussian Process (GP)
      regression has O(N<sup>3</sup>) runtime and O(N<sup>2</sup>) memory complexity,
      where N is the number of observations in the dataset. Given the computational
      resources available to a present-day workstation, this implies that GP regression
      simply <em>cannot be run</em> on large datasets. The need to use non- Gaussian
      likelihood functions for tasks such as classification adds even more to the
      computational burden involved.<br> The majority of algorithms designed to improve
      the scaling of GPs are founded on the idea of approximating the true covariance
      matrix, which is usually of rank N, with a matrix of rank P, where P   lt;   lt;N.
      Typically, the true training set is replaced with a smaller, representative
      (pseudo-) training set such that a specific measure of information loss is minimized.
      These algorithms typically attain O(P<sup>2</sup>N) runtime and O(PN) space
      complexity. They are also general in the sense that they are designed to work
      with <em>any</em> covariance function. In essence, they trade off accuracy with
      computational complexity. The central contribution of this thesis is to improve
      scaling instead by exploiting any structure that is present in the covariance
      matrices generated by <em>particular</em> covariance functions. Instead of settling
      for a kernel-independent accuracy/complexity trade off, as is done in much the
      literature, we often obtain accuracies close to, or exactly equal to the full
      GP model at a fraction of the computational cost.<br> We define a <em>structured</em>
      GP as any GP model that is endowed with a kernel which produces structured covariance
      matrices. A trivial example of a structured GP is one with the linear regression
      kernel. In this case, given inputs living in R<sup>D</sup>, the covariance matrices
      generated have rank D – this results in significant computational gains in the
      usual case where D   lt;   lt;N. Another case arises when a stationary kernel
      is evaluated on equispaced, scalar inputs. This results in <em>Toeplitz</em>
      covariance matrices and all necessary computations can be carried out exactly
      in O(N log N).<br> This thesis studies four more types of structured GP. First,
      we comprehensively review the case of kernels corresponding to <em>Gauss-Markov</em>
      processes evaluated on scalar inputs. Using state-space models we show how (generalised)
      regression (including hyperparameter learning) can be performed in O(N log N)
      runtime and O(N) space. Secondly, we study the case where we introduce block
      structure into the covariance matrix of a GP time-series model by assuming a
      particular form of nonstationarity a priori. Third, we extend the efficiency
      of scalar Gauss-Markov processes to higher-dimensional input spaces by assuming
      <em>additivity</em>. We illustrate the connections between the classical backfitting
      algorithm and approximate Bayesian inference techniques including Gibbs sampling
      and variational Bayes. We also show that it is possible to relax the rather
      strong assumption of additivity without sacrificing O(N log N) complexity, by
      means of a projection-pursuit style GP regression model. Finally, we study the
      properties of a GP model with a tensor product kernel evaluated on a multivariate
      grid of inputs locations. We show that for an <em>arbitrary</em> (regular or
      irregular) grid the resulting covariance matrices are Kronecker and full GP
      regression can be implemented in O(N) time and memory usage.<br> We illustrate
      the power of these methods on several real-world regression datasets which satisfy
      the assumptions inherent in the structured GP employed. In many cases we obtain
      performance comparable to the generic GP algorithm. We also analyse the performance
      degradation when these assumptions are not met, and in several cases show that
      it is comparable to that observed for sparse GP methods. We provide similar
      results for regression tasks with non-Gaussian likelihoods, an extension rarely
      addressed by sparse GP techniques.

    abstract: Many practitioners who use EM and related algorithms complain that they
      are sometimes slow. When does this happen, and what can be done about it? In
      this paper, we study the general class of bound optimization algorithms - including
      EM, Iterative Scaling, Non-negative Matrix Factorization, CCCP - and their relationship
      to direct optimization algorithms such as gradientbased methods for parameter
      learning. We derive a general relationship between the updates performed by
      bound optimization methods and those of gradient and second-order methods and
      identify analytic conditions under which bound optimization algorithms exhibit
      quasi-Newton behavior, and under which they possess poor, first-order convergence.
      Based on this analysis, we consider several specific algorithms, interpret and
      analyze their convergence properties and provide some recipes for preprocessing
      input to these algorithms to yield faster convergence behavior. We report empirical
      results supporting our analysis and showing that simple data preprocessing can
      result in dramatically improved performance of bound optimizers in practice.

    abstract: We show a close relationship between the Expectation- Maximization (EM)
      algorithm and direct optimization algorithms such as gradientbased methods for

      Newton-like behavior, and conditions under which it possesses poor, first-order

    abstract: 'Motivation: We present a method for directly inferring transcriptional
      modules (TMs) by integrating gene expression and transcription factor binding

      model to allow data fusion on a gene-by-gene basis. This encodes the intuition
      that co-expression and co-regulation are not necessarily equivalent and hence
      we do not expect all genes to group similarly in both datasets. In particular,
      it allows us to identify the subset of genes that share the same structure of
      transcriptional modules in both datasets.<br>Results: We find that by working
      on a gene-by-gene basis, our model is able to extract clusters with greater
      functional coherence than existing methods. By combining gene expression and

    abstract: We introduce a new approach to non-linear regression called function
      factorization, that is suitable for problems where an output variable can reasonably
      be modeled by a number of multiplicative interaction terms between non-linear
      functions of the inputs. The idea is to approximate a complicated function on
      a high-dimensional space by the sum of products of simpler functions on lower-dimensional
      subspaces. Function factorization can be seen as a generalization of matrix
      and tensor factorization methods, in which the data are approximated by the
      sum of outer products of vectors. We present a non-parametric Bayesian approach
      to function factorization where the priors over the factorizing functions are
      warped Gaussian processes, and we do inference using Hamiltonian Markov chain
      Monte Carlo. We demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the method
      on a food science data set compared to Gaussian process regression and tensor
      factorization using PARAFAC and GEMANOVA models.

    abstract: Runge-Kutta methods are the classic family of solvers for ordinary differential
      equations (ODEs), and the basis for the state-of-the-art. Like most numerical
      methods, they return point estimates. We construct a family of probabilistic
      numerical methods that instead return a Gauss-Markov process defining a probability
      distribution over the ODE solution. In contrast to prior work, we construct
      this family such that posterior means match the outputs of the Runge-Kutta family
      exactly, thus inheriting their proven good properties. Remaining degrees of
      freedom not identified by the match to Runge-Kutta are chosen such that the
      posterior probability measure fits the observed structure of the ODE. Our results
      shed light on the structure of Runge-Kutta solvers from a new direction, provide
      a richer, probabilistic output, have low computational cost, and raise new research
      questions.

    abstract: Data augmentation is often used to incorporate inductive biases into
      models. Traditionally, these are hand-crafted and tuned with cross validation.
      The Bayesian paradigm for model selection provides a path towards end-to-end
      learning of invariances using only the training data, by optimising the marginal
      likelihood. Computing the marginal likelihood is hard for neural networks, but
      success with tractable approaches that compute the marginal likelihood for the
      last layer only raises the question of whether this convenient approach might
      be employed for learning invariances. We show partial success on standard benchmarks,
      in the low-data regime and on a medical imaging dataset by designing a custom
      optimisation routine. Introducing a new lower bound to the marginal likelihood
      allows us to perform inference for a larger class of likelihood functions than
      before. On the other hand, we demonstrate failure modes on the CIFAR10 dataset,
      where the last layer approximation is not sufficient due to the increased complexity
      of our neural network. Our results indicate that once more sophisticated approximations
      become available the marginal likelihood is a promising approach for invariance
      learning in neural networks.

    abstract: Hypothalamic hypocretin/orexin (hcrt/orx) neurons recently emerged as
      critical regulators of sleep-wake cycles, reward-seeking, and body energy balance.
      However, at the level of cellular and network properties, it remains unclear
      whether hcrt/orx neurons are one homogenous population, or whether there are
      several distinct types of hcrt/orx cells. Here, we collated diverse structural
      and functional information about individual hcrt/orx neurons in mouse brain
      slices, by combining patch-clamp analysis of spike firing, membrane currents,
      and synaptic inputs with confocal imaging of cell shape and subsequent 3-dimensional
      Sholl analysis of dendritic architecture. Statistical cluster analysis of intrinsic
      firing properties revealed that hcrt/orx neurons fall into two distinct types.
      These two cell types also differ in the complexity of their dendritic arbour,
      the strength of AMPA and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic drive that they receive,
      and the density of low-threshold, 4-aminopyridine-sensitive, transient K+ current.
      Our results provide quantitative evidence that, at the cellular level, the mouse
      hcrt/orx system is composed of two classes of neurons with different firing
      properties, morphologies, and synaptic input organization.

    abstract: An important component for generalization in machine learning is to
      uncover underlying latent factors of variation as well as the mechanism through
      which each factor acts in the world. In this paper, we test whether 17 unsupervised,
      weakly supervised, and fully supervised representation learning approaches correctly
      infer the generative factors of variation in simple datasets (dSprites, Shapes3D,
      MPI3D) from controlled environments, and on our contributed CelebGlow dataset.
      In contrast to prior robustness work that introduces novel factors of variation
      during test time, such as blur or other (un)structured noise, we here recompose,
      interpolate, or extrapolate only existing factors of variation from the training
      data set (e.g., small and medium-sized objects during training and large objects
      during testing). Models that learn the correct mechanism should be able to generalize
      to this benchmark. In total, we train and test 2000+ models and observe that
      all of them struggle to learn the underlying mechanism regardless of supervision
      signal and architectural bias. Moreover, the generalization capabilities of
      all tested models drop significantly as we move from artificial datasets towards
      more realistic real-world datasets. Despite their inability to identify the
      correct mechanism, the models are quite modular as their ability to infer other
      in-distribution factors remains fairly stable, providing only a single factor
      is out-of-distribution. These results point to an important yet understudied
      problem of learning mechanistic models of observations that can facilitate generalization.

    abstract: Probabilistic modelling offers a simple and coherent framework to describe
      the real world in the face of uncertainty. Furthermore, by applying Bayes' rule
      it is possible to use probabilistic models to make inferences about the state
      of the world from partial observations. While traditionally probabilistic models
      were constructed on paper, more recently the approach of probabilistic programming
      enables users to write the models in executable languages resembling computer
      programs and to freely mix them with deterministic code. It has long been recognised
      that the semantics of programming languages is complicated and the intuitive
      understanding that programmers have is often inaccurate, resulting in difficult
      to understand bugs and unexpected program behaviours. Programming languages
      are therefore studied in a rigorous way using formal languages with mathematically
      defined semantics. Traditionally formal semantics of probabilistic programs
      are defined using exact inference results, but in practice exact Bayesian inference
      is not tractable and approximate methods are used instead, posing a question
      of how the results of these algorithms relate to the exact results. Correctness
      of such approximate methods is usually argued somewhat less rigorously, without
      reference to a formal semantics. In this dissertation we formally develop denotational
      semantics for probabilistic programs that correspond to popular sampling algorithms
      often used in practice. The semantics is defined for an expressive typed lambda
      calculus with higher-order functions and inductive types, extended with probabilistic
      effects for sampling and conditioning, allowing continuous distributions and
      unbounded likelihoods. It makes crucial use of the recently developed formalism
      of quasi-Borel spaces to bring all these elements together. We provide semantics
      corresponding to several variants of Markov chain Monte Carlo and Sequential
      Monte Carlo methods and formally prove a notion of correctness for these algorithms
      in the context of probabilistic programming. We also show that the semantic
      construction can be directly mapped to an implementation using established functional
      programming abstractions called monad transformers. We develop a compact Haskell
      library for probabilistic programming closely corresponding to the semantic
      construction, giving users a high level of assurance in the correctness of the
      implementation. We also demonstrate on a collection of benchmarks that the library
      offers performance competitive with existing systems of similar scope. An important
      property of our construction, both the semantics and the implementation, is
      the high degree of modularity it offers. All the inference algorithms are constructed
      by combining small building blocks in a setup where the type system ensures
      correctness of compositions. We show that with basic building blocks corresponding
      to vanilla Metropolis-Hastings and Sequential Monte Carlo we can implement more
      advanced algorithms known in the literature, such as Resample-Move Sequential
      Monte Carlo, Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings, and Sequential Monte Carlo
      squared. These implementations are very concise, reducing the effort required
      to produce them and the scope for bugs. On top of that, our modular construction
      enables in some cases deterministic testing of randomised inference algorithms,
      further increasing reliability of the implementation.

    abstract: The machine learning community has recently shown a lot of interest
      in practical probabilistic programming systems that target the problem of Bayesian
      inference. Such systems come in different forms, but they all express probabilistic
      models as computational processes using syntax resembling programming languages.
      In the functional programming community monads are known to offer a convenient
      and elegant abstraction for programming with probability distributions, but
      their use is often limited to very simple inference problems. We show that it
      is possible to use the monad abstraction to construct probabilistic models for
      machine learning, while still offering good performance of inference in challenging
      models. We use a GADT as an underlying representation of a probability distribution
      and apply Sequential Monte Carlo-based methods to achieve efficient inference.
      We define a formal semantics via measure theory. We demonstrate a clean and
      elegant implementation that achieves performance comparable with Anglican, a
      state-of-the-art probabilistic programming system.

    abstract: 'We present an architectural design of a library for Bayesian modelling
      and inference in modern functional programming languages. The novel aspect of
      our approach are modular implementations of existing state-of-the-art inference
      algorithms. Our design relies on three inherently functional features: higher-order
      functions, inductive data-types, and support for either type-classes or an expressive
      module system. We provide a performant Haskell implementation of this architecture,
      demonstrating that high-level and modular probabilistic programming can be added
      as a library in sufficiently expressive languages. We review the core abstractions
      in this architecture: inference representations, inference transformations,
      and inference representation transformers. We then implement concrete instances
      of these abstractions, counterparts to particle filters and Metropolis-Hastings
      samplers, which form the basic building blocks of our library. By composing
      these building blocks we obtain state-of-the-art inference algorithms: Resample-Move
      Sequential Monte Carlo, Particle Marginal Metropolis-Hastings, and Sequential
      Monte Carlo Squared. We evaluate our implementation against existing probabilistic
      programming systems and find it is already competitively performant, although
      we conjecture that existing functional programming optimisation techniques could

    abstract: 'We present a modular semantic account of Bayesian inference algorithms
      for probabilistic programming languages, as used in data science and machine
      learning. Sophisticated inference algorithms are often explained in terms of
      composition of smaller parts. However, neither their theoretical justification
      nor their implementation reflects this modularity. We show how to conceptualise
      and analyse such inference algorithms as manipulating intermediate representations
      of probabilistic programs using higher-order functions and inductive types,
      and their denotational semantics. Semantic accounts of continuous distributions
      use measurable spaces. However, our use of higher-order functions presents a
      substantial technical difficulty: it is impossible to define a measurable space
      structure over the collection of measurable functions between arbitrary measurable
      spaces that is compatible with standard operations on those functions, such
      as function application. We overcome this difficulty using quasi-Borel spaces,
      a recently proposed mathematical structure that supports both function spaces
      and continuous distributions. We define a class of semantic structures for representing
      probabilistic programs, and semantic validity criteria for transformations of
      these representations in terms of distribution preservation. We develop a collection
      of building blocks for composing representations. We use these building blocks
      to validate common inference algorithms such as Sequential Monte Carlo and Markov
      Chain Monte Carlo. To emphasize the connection between the semantic manipulation
      and its traditional measure theoretic origins, we use Kock’s synthetic measure
      theory. We demonstrate its usefulness by proving a quasi-Borel counterpart to
      the Metropolis-Hastings-Green theorem.'

    abstract: 'A Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings algo- rithm is introduced, for
      the purpose of sampling from a target distribution with strongly nonlin- ear
      support. The algorithm embeds the trajec- tory of the Markov chain into a reproducing
      ker- nel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the fea- ture space covariance of the
      samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is com- putationally efficient
      and straightforward to im- plement, since the RKHS moves can be inte- grated
      out analytically: our proposal distribu- tion in the original space is a normal
      distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies
      in the support of the tar- get distribution, and adapts to its local covari-
      ance structure. Furthermore, the procedure re- quires neither gradients nor
      any other higher or- der information about the target, making it par- ticularly
      attractive for contexts such as Pseudo- Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-
      Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adap- tive samplers on multivariate,
      highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world and synthetic

    abstract: Ensembles of geophysical models improve projection accuracy and express
      uncertainties. We develop a novel data-driven ensembling strategy for combining
      geophysical models using Bayesian Neural Networks, which infers spatiotemporally
      varying model weights and bias while accounting for heteroscedastic uncertainties
      in the observations. This produces more accurate and uncertainty-aware projections
      without sacrificing interpretability. Applied to the prediction of total column
      ozone from an ensemble of 15 chemistry-climate models, we find that the Bayesian
      neural network ensemble (BayNNE) outperforms existing ensembling methods, achieving
      a 49.4% reduction in RMSE for temporal extrapolation, and a 67.4% reduction
      in RMSE for polar data voids, compared to a weighted mean. Uncertainty is also
      well-characterized, with 90.6% of the data points in our extrapolation validation
      dataset lying within 2 standard deviations and 98.5% within 3 standard deviations.

    abstract: Semi-supervised clustering is the task of clustering data points into
      clusters where only a fraction of the points are labelled. The true number of
      clusters in the data is often unknown and most models require this parameter
      as an input. Dirichlet process mixture models are appealing as they can infer
      the number of clusters from the data. However, these models do not deal with
      high dimensional data well and can encounter difficulties in inference. We present
      a novel nonparameteric Bayesian kernel based method to cluster data points without
      the need to prespecify the number of clusters or to model complicated densities
      from which data points are assumed to be generated from. The key insight is
      to use determinants of submatrices of a kernel matrix as a measure of how close
      together a set of points are. We explore some theoretical properties of the
      model and derive a natural Gibbs based algorithm with MCMC hyperparameter learning.
      The model is implemented on a variety of synthetic and real world data sets.

    abstract: We propose a new learning method to infer a mid-level feature representation
      that combines the advantage of semantic attribute representations with the higher
      expressive power of non-semantic features. The idea lies in augmenting an existing
      attribute-based representation with additional dimensions for which an autoencoder
      model is coupled with a large-margin principle. This construction allows a smooth
      transition between the zero-shot regime with no training example, the unsupervised
      regime with training examples but without class labels, and the supervised regime
      with training examples and with class labels. The resulting optimization problem
      can be solved efficiently, because several of the necessity steps have closed-form
      solutions. Through extensive experiments we show that the augmented representation
      achieves better results in terms of object categorization accuracy than the
      semantic representation alone.

    abstract: Many computer vision problems have an asymmetric distribution of information
      between training and test time. In this work, we study the case where we are
      given additional information about the training data, which however will not
      be available at test time. This situation is called learning using privileged
      information (LUPI). We introduce two maximum-margin techniques that are able
      to make use of this additional source of information, and we show that the framework
      is applicable to several scenarios that have been studied in computer vision
      before. Experiments with attributes, bounding boxes, image tags and rationales
      as additional information in object classification show promising results.

    abstract: We investigate the Student-t process as an alternative to the Gaussian
      process as a nonparametric prior over functions. We derive closed form expressions
      for the marginal likelihood and predictive distribution of a Student-t process,
      by integrating away an inverse Wishart process prior over the covariance kernel
      of a Gaussian process model. We show surprising equivalences between different
      hierarchical Gaussian process models leading to Student-t processes, and derive
      a new sampling scheme for the inverse Wishart process, which helps elucidate
      these equivalences. Overall, we show that a Student-t process can retain the
      attractive properties of a Gaussian process – a nonparametric representation,
      analytic marginal and predictive distributions, and easy model selection through
      covariance kernels – but has enhanced flexibility, and predictive covariances
      that, unlike a Gaussian process, explicitly depend on the values of training
      observations. We verify empirically that a Student-t process is especially useful
      in situations where there are changes in covariance structure, or in applications
      like Bayesian optimization, where accurate predictive covariances are critical
      for good performance. These advantages come at no additional computational cost
      over Gaussian processes.

    abstract: 'Modern machine learning research relies on relatively few carefully
      curated datasets. Even in these datasets, and typically in `untidy'' or raw
      data, practitioners are faced with significant issues of data quality and diversity
      which can be prohibitively labor intensive to address. Existing methods for
      dealing with these challenges tend to make strong assumptions about the particular
      issues at play, and often require a priori knowledge or metadata such as domain
      labels. Our work is orthogonal to these methods: we instead focus on providing
      a unified and efficient framework for Metadata Archaeology – uncovering and
      inferring metadata of examples in a dataset. We curate different subsets of
      data that might exist in a dataset (e.g. mislabeled, atypical, or out-of-distribution
      examples) using simple transformations, and leverage differences in learning
      dynamics between these probe suites to infer metadata of interest. Our method
      is on par with far more sophisticated mitigation methods across different tasks:
      identifying and correcting mislabeled examples, classifying minority-group samples,
      prioritizing points relevant for training and enabling scalable human auditing
      of relevant examples.'

    abstract: 'When predicting class labels for objects within a relational database,
      it is often helpful to consider a model for relationships: this allows for information
      between class labels to be shared and to improve prediction performance. However,
      there are different ways by which objects can be related within a relational
      database. One traditional way corresponds to a Markov network structure: each
      existing relation is represented by an undirected edge. This encodes that, conditioned
      on input features, each object label is independent of other object labels given
      its neighbors in the graph. However, there is no reason why Markov networks
      should be the only representation of choice for symmetric dependence structures.
      Here we discuss the case when relationships are postulated to exist due to hidden
      common causes. We discuss how the resulting graphical model differs from Markov
      networks, and how it describes different types of real-world relational processes.
      A Bayesian nonparametric classification model is built upon this graphical representation
      and evaluated with several empirical studies.'

    abstract: We introduce priors and algorithms to perform Bayesian inference in
      Gaussian models defined by acyclic directed mixed graphs. Such a class of graphs,
      composed of directed and bi-directed edges, is a representation of conditional
      independencies that is closed under marginalization and arises naturally from
      causal models which allow for unmeasured confounding. Monte Carlo methods and
      a variational approximation for such models are presented. Our algorithms for
      Bayesian inference allow the evaluation of posterior distributions for several
      quantities of interest, including causal effects that are not identifiable from
      data alone but could otherwise be inferred where informative prior knowledge
      about confounding is available.

    abstract: 'Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) have been widely used as a representation
      of conditional independence in machine learning and statistics. Moreover, hidden
      or latent variables are often an important component of graphical models. However,
      DAG models suffer from an important limitation: the family of DAGs is not closed
      under marginalization of hidden variables. This means that in general we cannot
      use a DAG to represent the independencies over a subset of variables in a larger
      DAG. Directed mixed graphs (DMGs) are a representation that includes DAGs as
      a special case, and overcomes this limitation. This paper introduces algorithms
      for performing Bayesian inference in Gaussian and probit DMG models. An important
      requirement for inference is the specification of the distribution over parameters
      of the models. We introduce a new distribution for covariance matrices of Gaussian
      DMGs. We discuss and illustrate how several Bayesian machine learning tasks
      can benefit from the principle presented here: the power to model dependencies
      that are generated from hidden variables, but without necessarily modeling such
      variables explicitly.'

    abstract: Marginal independence constraints play an important role in learning
      with graphical models. One way of parameterizing a model of marginal independencies
      is by building a latent variable model where two independent observed variables
      have no common latent source. In sparse domains, however, it might be advantageous
      to model the marginal observed distribution directly, without explicitly including
      latent variables in the model. There have been recent advances in Gaussian and
      binary models of marginal independence, but no models with non-linear dependencies
      between continuous variables has been proposed so far. In this paper, we describe
      how to generalize the Gaussian model of marginal independencies based on mixtures,
      and how to learn parameters. This requires a non-standard parameterization and
      raises difficult non-linear optimization issues.

    abstract: 'Analogical reasoning depends fundamentally on the ability to learn
      and generalize about relations between objects. There are many ways in which
      objects can be related, making automated analogical reasoning very chal- lenging.
      Here we develop an approach which, given a set of pairs of related objects S
      = A1:B1,A2:B2,...,AN:BN, measures how well other pairs A:B fit in with the set
      S. This addresses the question: is the relation between objects A and B analogous
      to those relations found in S? We recast this classi- cal problem as a problem
      of Bayesian analy- sis of relational data. This problem is non- trivial because
      direct similarity between ob- jects is not a good way of measuring analo- gies.
      For instance, the analogy between an electron around the nucleus of an atom
      and a planet around the Sun is hardly justified by isolated, non-relational,
      comparisons of an electron to a planet, and a nucleus to the Sun. We develop
      a generative model for predicting the existence of relationships and extend
      the framework of Ghahramani and Heller (2005) to provide a Bayesian measure
      for how analogous a relation is to other relations. This sheds new light on

    abstract: 'Kernel selection plays a central role in determining the performance

      biases and prior support of functions under the GP prior. This work addresses
      the challenge of constructing custom kernel functions for high-dimensional GP
      regression models. Drawing inspiration from recent progress in deep learning,
      we introduce a novel approach named KITT: Kernel Identification Through Transformers.
      KITT exploits a transformer-based architecture to generate kernel recommendations
      in under 0.1 seconds, which is several orders of magnitude faster than conventional
      kernel search algorithms. We train our model using synthetic data generated
      from priors over a vocabulary of known kernels. By exploiting the nature of
      the self-attention mechanism, KITT is able to process datasets with inputs of
      arbitrary dimension. We demonstrate that kernels chosen by KITT yield strong
      performance over a diverse collection of regression benchmarks.'

      distributions. We benchmark against Hamiltonian Monte Carlo on time-series and
      two-dimensional regression tasks, finding that a principled approach to quantifying
      hyperparameter uncertainty substantially improves the quality of prediction
      intervals.

    abstract: We provide a theoretical foundation for non-parametric estimation of
      functions of random variables using kernel mean embeddings. We show that for
      any continuous function f, consistent estimators of the mean embedding of a
      random variable X lead to consistent estimators of the mean embedding of f(X).
      For Matérn kernels and sufficiently smooth functions we also provide rates of
      convergence. Our results extend to functions of multiple random variables. If
      the variables are dependent, we require an estimator of the mean embedding of
      their joint distribution as a starting point; if they are independent, it is
      sufficient to have separate estimators of the mean embeddings of their marginal
      distributions. In either case, our results cover both mean embeddings based
      on i.i.d. samples as well as "reduced set" expansions in terms of dependent
      expansion points. The latter serves as a justification for using such expansions
      to limit memory resources when applying the approach as a basis for probabilistic
      programming.

    abstract: 'We compare two approaches to the problem of estimating the depth of
      a point in space from observing its image position in two different cameras:
      1. The classical photogrammetric approach explicitly models the two cameras
      and estimates their intrinsic and extrinsic parameters using a tedious calibration
      procedure; 2. A generic machine learning approach where the mapping from image
      to spatial coordinates is directly approximated by a Gaussian Process regression.
      Our results show that the generic learning approach, in addition to simplifying
      the procedure of calibration, can lead to higher depth accuracies than classical
      calibration although no specific domain knowledge is used.'

    abstract: This paper presents three iterative methods for orientation estimation.
      The first two are based on iterated Extended Kalman filter (IEKF) formulations
      with different state representations. The first is using the well-known unit
      quaternion as state (q-IEKF) while the other is using orientation deviation
      which we call IMEKF. The third method is based on nonlinear least squares (NLS)
      estimation of the angular velocity which is used to parametrise the orientation.
      The results are obtained using Monte Carlo simulations and the comparison is
      done with the non-iterative EKF and multiplicative EKF (MEKF) as baseline. The
      result clearly shows that the IMEKF and the NLS-based method are superior to
      q-IEKF and all three outperform the non-iterative methods.

    abstract: We provide a general framework for learning precise, compact, and fast
      representations of the Bayesian predictive distribution for a model. This framework
      is based on minimizing the KL divergence between the true predictive density
      and a suitable compact approximation. We consider various methods for doing
      this, both sampling based approximations, and deterministic approximations such
      as expectation propagation. These methods are tested on a mixture of Gaussians
      model for density estimation and on binary linear classification, with both
      synthetic data sets for visualization and several real data sets. Our results
      show significant reductions in prediction time and memory footprint.

    abstract: We present a new Gaussian process (GP) regression model whose covariance
      is parameterized by the the locations of M pseudo-input points, which we learn
      by a gradient based optimization. We take M   lt;   lt;N, where N is the number
      of real data points, and hence obtain a sparse regression method which has O(NM<sup>2</sup>)
      training cost and O(M<sup>2</sup>) prediction cost per test case. We also find
      hyperparameters of the covariance function in the same joint optimization. The
      method can be viewed as a Bayesian regression model with particular input dependent
      noise. The method turns out to be closely related to several other sparse GP
      approaches, and we discuss the relation in detail. We finally demonstrate its
      performance on some large data sets, and make a direct comparison to other sparse
      GP methods. We show that our method can match full GP performance with small
      M, i.e. very sparse solutions, and it significantly outperforms other approaches
      in this regime.

  SneGha06b:
    abstract: The sparse pseudo-input Gaussian process (SPGP) is a new approximation
      method for speeding up GP regression in the case of a large number of data points
      N. The approximation is controlled by the gradient optimization of a small set
      of M pseudo-inputs, thereby reducing complexity from O(N<sup>3</sup>) to O(NM<sup>2</sup>).
      One limitation of the SPGP is that this optimization space becomes impractically
      big for high dimensional data sets. This paper addresses this limitation by
      performing automatic dimensionality reduction. A projection of the input space
      to a low dimensional space is learned in a supervised manner, alongside the
      pseudo-inputs, which now live in this reduced space. The paper also investigates
      the suitability of the SPGP for modeling data with input-dependent noise. A
      further extension of the model is made to make it even more powerful in this
      regard - we learn an uncertainty parameter for each pseudo-input. The combination
      of sparsity, reduced dimension, and input-dependent noise makes it possible
      to apply GPs to much larger and more complex data sets than was previously practical.
      We demonstrate the benefits of these methods on several synthetic and real world
      problems.

    abstract: Gaussian process (GP) models are flexible probabilistic nonparametric
      models for regression, classification and other tasks. Unfortunately they suffer
      from computational intractability for large data sets. Over the past decade
      there have been many different approximations developed to reduce this cost.
      Most of these can be termed global approximations, in that they try to summarize
      all the training data via a small set of support points. A different approach
      is that of local regression, where many local experts account for their own
      part of space. In this paper we start by investigating the regimes in which
      these different approaches work well or fail. We then proceed to develop a new
      sparse GP approximation which is a combination of both the global and local
      approaches. Theoretically we show that it is derived as a natural extension
      of the framework developed by <a href="/pub/#QuiRas05">Quiñonero-Candela and
      Rasmussen</a> for sparse GP approximations. We demonstrate the benefits of the
      combined approximation on some 1D examples for illustration, and on some large
      real-world data sets.

    abstract: We generalise the Gaussian process (GP) framework for regression by
      learning a nonlinear transformation of the GP outputs. This allows for non-Gaussian
      processes and non-Gaussian noise. The learning algorithm chooses a nonlinear
      transformation such that transformed data is well-modelled by a GP. This can
      be seen as including a preprocessing transformation as an integral part of the
      probabilistic modelling problem, rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate
      on several real regression problems that learning the transformation can lead
      to significantly better performance than using a regular GP, or a GP with a
      fixed transformation.

    abstract: We present a new haplotype-based approach for inferring local genetic
      ancestry of individuals in an admixed population. Most existing approaches for
      local ancestry estimation ignore the latent genetic relatedness between ancestral
      populations and treat them as independent. In this paper, we exploit such information
      by building an inheritance model that describes both the ancestral populations
      and the admixed population jointly in a unified framework. Based on an assumption
      that the common hypothetical founder haplotypes give rise to both the ancestral
      and admixed population haplotypes, we employ an infinite hidden Markov model
      to characterize each ancestral population and further extend it to generate
      the admixed population. Through an effective utilization of the population structural
      information under a principled nonparametric Bayesian framework, the resulting
      model is significantly less sensitive to the choice and the amount of training
      data for ancestral populations than state-of-the-arts algorithms. We also improve
      the robustness under deviation from common modeling assumptions by incorporating
      population-specific scale parameters that allow variable recombination rates
      in different populations. Our method is applicable to an admixed population
      from an arbitrary number of ancestral populations and also performs competitively
      in terms of spurious ancestry proportions under general multi-way admixture
      assumption. We validate the proposed method by simulation under various admixing
      scenarios and present empirical analysis results on worldwide distributed dataset
      from Human Genome Diversity Project.

    abstract: Gaussian processes provide an approach to nonparametric modelling which
      allows a straightforward combination of function and derivative observations
      in an empirical model. This is of particular importance in identification of
      nonlinear dynamic systems from experimental data. 1) It allows us to combine
      derivative information, and associated uncertainty with normal function observations
      into the learning and inference process. This derivative information can be
      in the form of priors specified by an expert or identified from perturbation
      data close to equilibrium. 2) It allows a seamless fusion of multiple local
      linear models in a consistent manner, inferring consistent models and ensuring
      that integrability constraints are met. 3) It improves dramatically the computational
      efficiency of Gaussian process models for dynamic system identification, by
      summarising large quantities of near-equilibrium data by a handful of linearisations,
      reducing the training set size - traditionally a problem for Gaussian process
      models.

    abstract: Open source tools have recently reached a level of maturity which makes
      them suitable for building large-scale real-world systems. At the same time,
      the field of machine learning has developed a large body of powerful learning
      algorithms for diverse applications. However, the true potential of these methods
      is not realized, since existing implementations are not openly shared, resulting
      in software with low usability, and weak interoperability. We argue that this
      situation can be significantly improved by increasing incentives for researchers
      to publish their software under an open source model. Additionally, we outline
      the problems authors are faced with when trying to publish algorithmic implementations
      of machine learning methods. We believe that a resource of peer reviewed software
      accompanied by short articles would be highly valuable to both the machine learning
      and the general scientific community.

    abstract: We consider the computational complexity of probabilistic inference
      in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). First, we study the problem of finding
      the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of topics to words, where the document's
      topic distribution is integrated out. We show that, when the effective number
      of topics per document is small, exact inference takes polynomial time. In contrast,
      we show that, when a document has a large number of topics, finding the MAP
      assignment of topics to words in LDA is NP-hard. Next, we consider the problem
      of finding the MAP topic distribution for a document, where the topic-word assignments
      are integrated out. We show that this problem is also NP-hard. Finally, we briefly
      discuss the problem of sampling from the posterior, showing that this is NP-hard
      in one restricted setting, but leaving open the general question.

    abstract: 'Discrimination via algorithmic decision making has received considerable
      attention. Prior work largely focuses on defining conditions for fairness, but
      does not define satisfactory measures of algorithmic unfairness. In this paper,
      we focus on the following question: Given two unfair algorithms, how should
      we determine which of the two is more unfair? Our core idea is to use existing
      inequality indices from economics to measure how unequally the outcomes of an
      algorithm benefit different individuals or groups in a population. Our work
      offers a justified and general framework to compare and contrast the (un)fairness
      of algorithmic predictors. This unifying approach enables us to quantify unfairness
      both at the individual and the group level. Further, our work reveals overlooked
      tradeoffs between different fairness notions: using our proposed measures, the
      overall individual-level unfairness of an algorithm can be decomposed into a
      between-group and a within-group component. Earlier methods are typically designed
      to tackle only between-group unfairness, which may be justified for legal or
      other reasons. However, we demonstrate that minimizing exclusively the between-group
      component may, in fact, increase the within-group, and hence the overall unfairness.
      We characterize and illustrate the tradeoffs between our measures of (un)fairness
      and the prediction accuracy.'

    abstract: Small datasets are ubiquitous in drug discovery as data generation is
      expensive and can be restricted for ethical reasons (eg in vivo experiments).
      A widely applied technique in early drug discovery to identify novel active
      molecules against a protein target is modelling quantitative structure-activity
      relationships (QSAR). It is known to be extremely challenging, as available
      measurements of compound activities range in the low dozens or hundreds. However,
      many such related datasets exist, each with a small number of datapoints, opening
      up the opportunity for few-shot learning after pre-training on a substantially
      larger corpus of data. At the same time, many few-shot learning methods are
      currently evaluated in the computer-vision domain. We propose that expansion
      into a new application, as well as the possibility to use explicitly graph-structured
      data, will drive exciting progress in few-shot learning. Here, we provide a
      few-shot learning dataset (FS-Mol) and complementary benchmarking procedure.
      We define a set of tasks on which few-shot learning methods can be evaluated,
      with a separate set of tasks for use in pre-training. In addition, we implement
      and evaluate a number of existing single-task, multi-task, and meta-learning
      approaches as baselines for the community. We hope that our dataset, support
      code release, and baselines will encourage future work on this extremely challenging
      new domain for few-shot learning.

    abstract: This article describes lossless compression algorithms for multisets
      of sequences, taking advantage of the multiset's unordered structure. Multisets
      are a generalisation of sets where members are allowed to occur multiple times.
      A multiset can be encoded naively by simply storing its elements in some sequential
      order, but then information is wasted on the ordering. We propose a technique
      that transforms the multiset into an order-invariant tree representation, and
      derive an arithmetic code that optimally compresses the tree. Our method achieves
      compression even if the sequences in the multiset are individually incompressible
      (such as cryptographic hash sums). The algorithm is demonstrated practically
      by compressing collections of SHA-1 hash sums, and multisets of arbitrary, individually
      encodable objects.

    abstract: This article makes several improvements to the classic PPM algorithm,
      resulting in a new algorithm with superior compression effectiveness on human
      text. The key differences of our algorithm to classic PPM are that (A) rather
      than the original escape mechanism, we use a generalised blending method with
      explicit hyper-parameters that control the way symbol counts are combined to
      form predictions; (B) different hyper-parameters are used for classes of different
      contexts; and (C) these hyper-parameters are updated dynamically using gradient
      information. The resulting algorithm (PPM-DP) compresses human text better than
      all currently published variants of PPM, CTW, DMC, LZ, CSE and BWT, with runtime
      only slightly slower than classic PPM.

    abstract: Most of the world's digital data is currently encoded in a sequential
      form, and compression methods for sequences have been studied extensively. However,
      there are many types of non-sequential data for which good compression techniques
      are still largely unexplored. This paper contributes insights and concrete techniques
      for compressing various kinds of non-sequential data via arithmetic coding,
      and derives re-usable probabilistic data models from fairly generic structural
      assumptions. Near-optimal compression methods are described for certain types
      of permutations, combinations and multisets; and the conditions for optimality
      are made explicit for each method.

    abstract: Understanding the regulatory mechanisms that are responsible for an
      organism's response to environmental change is an important issue in molecular
      biology. A first and important step towards this goal is to detect genes whose
      expression levels are affected by altered external conditions. A range of methods
      to test for differential gene expression, both in static as well as in time-course
      experiments, have been proposed. While these tests answer the question whether
      a gene is differentially expressed, they do not explicitly address the question
      when a gene is differentially expressed, although this information may provide
      insights into the course and causal structure of regulatory programs. In this
      article, we propose a twosample test for identifying intervals of differential
      gene expression in microarray time series. Our approach is based on Gaussian
      process regression, can deal with arbitrary numbers of replicates, and is robust
      with respect to outliers. We apply our algorithm to study the response of Arabidopsis
      thaliana genes to an infection by a fungal pathogen using a microarray time
      series dataset covering 30,336 gene probes at 24 observed time points. In classification
      experiments, our test compares favorably with existing methods and provides
      additional insights into time-dependent differential expression.

    abstract: A wealth of time series of microarray measurements have become available
      over recent years. Several two-sample tests for detecting differential gene
      expression in these time series have been defined, but they can only answer
      the question whether a gene is differentially expressed across the whole time
      series, not in which intervals it is differentially expressed. In this article,
      we propose a Gaussian process based approach for studying these dynamics of
      differential gene expression. In experiments on Arabidopsis thaliana gene expression
      levels, our novel technique helps us to uncover that the family of WRKY transcription
      factors appears to be involved in the early response to infection by a fungal
      pathogen.

    abstract: When building priors over trees for Bayesian hierarchical models, there
      is a tension between maintaining desirable theoretical properties such as infinite
      exchangeability and important practical properties such as the ability to increase
      the depth of the tree to accommodate new data. We resolve this tension by presenting
      a family of infinitely exchangeable priors over discrete tree structures that
      allows the depth of the tree to grow with the data, and then showing that our
      family contains all hierarchical models with certain mild symmetry properties.
      We also show that deep hierarchical models are in general intimately tied to
      a process called a martingale, and use Doob’s martingale convergence theorem
      to demonstrate some unexpected properties of deep hierarchies.

    abstract: The Infinite Hidden Markov Model (IHMM) extends hidden Markov models
      to have a countably infinite number of hidden states (<a href="/pub/#BeaGhaRas02">Beal
      et al., 2002</a>; Teh et al., 2006). We present a generalization of this framework
      that introduces nearly block-diagonal structure in the transitions between the
      hidden states, where blocks correspond to "sub-behaviors" exhibited by data
      sequences. In identifying such structure, the model classifies, or partitions,
      sequence data according to these sub-behaviors in an unsupervised way. We present
      an application of this model to artificial data, a video gesture classification
      task, and a musical theme labeling task, and show that components of the model
      can also be applied to graph segmentation.

    abstract: In this paper we consider latent variable models and introduce a new
      U-likelihood concept for estimating the distribution over hidden variables.
      One can derive an estimate of parameters from this distribution. Our approach
      differs from the Bayesian and Maximum Likelihood (ML) approaches. It gives an
      alternative to Bayesian inference when we don't want to define a prior over
      parameters and gives an alternative to the ML method when we want a better estimate
      of the distribution over hidden variables. As a practical implementation, we
      present a U-updating algorithm based on the mean field theory to approximate
      the distribution over hidden variables from the U-likelihood. This algorithm
      captures some of the correlations among hidden variables by estimating reaction
      terms. Those reaction terms are found to penalize the likelihood. We show that
      the U-updating algorithm becomes the EM algorithm as a special case in the large
      sample limit. The useful behavior of our method is confirmed for the case of
      mixture of Gaussians by comparing to the EM algorithm.

    abstract: Variational Bayesian Expectation-Maximization (VBEM), an approximate
      inference method for probabilistic models based on factorizing over latent variables
      and model parameters, has been a standard technique for practical Bayesian inference.
      In this paper, we introduce a more general approximate inference framework for
      conjugate-exponential family models, which we call Latent-Space Variational
      Bayes (LSVB). In this approach, we integrate out the model parameters in an
      exact way, leaving only the latent variables. It can be shown that the LSVB
      approach gives better estimates of the model evidence as well as the distribution
      over the latent variables than the VBEM approach, but, in practice, the distribution
      over the latent variables has to be approximated. As a practical implementation,
      we present a First-order LSVB (FoLSVB) algorithm to approximate the distribution
      over the latent variables. From this approximate distribution, one can also
      estimate the model evidence and the posterior over the model parameters. The
      FoLSVB algorithm is directly comparable to the VBEM algorithm and has the same
      computational complexity. We discuss how LSVB generalizes the recently proposed
      collapsed variational methods to general conjugate-exponential families. Examples
      based on mixtures of Gaussians and mixtures of Bernoullis with synthetic and
      real-world data sets are used to illustrate some advantages of our method over
      VBEM.

      a second-order LSVB (SoLSVB) method. In particular, VBEM can be derived as a
      special case of a first-order approximation in LSVB. SoLSVB can capture higher
      order statistics neglected in VBEM and can therefore achieve a better approximation.
      Examples of Gaussian mixture models are used to illustrate the comparison between
      our method and VBEM, demonstrating the improvement.

    abstract: Learning generative object models from unlabelled videos is a long standing
      problem and required for causal scene modeling. We decompose this problem into
      three easier subtasks, and provide candidate solutions for each of them. Inspired
      by the Common Fate Principle of Gestalt Psychology, we first extract (noisy)
      masks of moving objects via unsupervised motion segmentation. Second, generative
      models are trained on the masks of the background and the moving objects, respectively.
      Third, background and foreground models are combined in a conditional "dead
      leaves" scene model to sample novel scene configurations where occlusions and
      depth layering arise naturally. To evaluate the individual stages, we introduce
      the Fishbowl dataset positioned between complex real-world scenes and common
      object-centric benchmarks of simplistic objects. We show that our approach allows
      learning generative models that generalize beyond the occlusions present in
      the input videos, and represent scenes in a modular fashion that allows sampling
      plausible scenes outside the training distribution by permitting, for instance,
      object numbers or densities not observed in the training set.

    abstract: 'This thesis concerns the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as distributions
      over unknown functions in Machine Learning and probabilistic modeling. GPs have
      been found to have utility in a wide range of applications owing to their flexibility,
      interpretability, and tractability. I advance their use in three directions.
      Firstly, the abstractions upon which software is built for their use in practice.
      In modern GP software libraries such as GPML, GPy, GPflow, and GPyTorch, the
      kernel is undoubtedly the dominant abstraction. While it remains highly successful
      it of course has limitations, and I propose to address some of these through
      a complementary abstraction: affine transformations of GPs. Specifically I show
      how a collection of GPs, and affine transformations thereof, can themselves
      be treated as a single GP. This in turn leads to a design for software, including
      exact and approximate inference algorithms. I demonstrate the utility of this
      software through a collection of worked examples, focussing on models which
      are more cleanly and easily expressed using this new software. Secondly, I develop
      a new scalable approximate inference algorithm for a class of GPs commonly utilised
      in spatio-temporal problems. This is a setting in which GPs excel, for example
      enabling the incorporation of important inductive biases, and observations made
      at arbitrary points in time and space. However, the computation required to
      perform exact inference and learning in GPs scales cubically in the number of
      observations, necessitating approximation, to which end I combine two important
      complementary classes of approximation: pseudo-point and Markovian. The key
      contribution is the insight that a simple and useful way to combine them turns
      out to be well-justified. This resolves an open question in the literature,
      provides new insight into existing work, and a new family of approximations.
      The efficacy of an important member of this family is demonstrated empirically.
      Finally I develop a GP model and associated approximate inference techniques
      for the prediction of sea surface temperatures (SSTs) on decadal time scales,
      which are relevant when taking planning decisions which consider resilience
      to climate change. There remains a large degree of uncertainty as to the state
      of the climate on such time scales, but it is thought to be possible to reduce
      this by exploiting the predictability of natural variability in the climate.
      The developed GP-based model incorporates a key assumption used by the existing
      statistical models employed for decadal prediction, thus retaining a valuable
      inductive bias, while offering several advantages. Amongst these is the lack
      of need for spatial aggregation of data, which is especially relevant when data
      are sparse, as is the case with historical ocean SST data. In summary, this
      thesis contributes to the practical use of GPs through a set of abstractions
      that are useful in the design of software, algorithms for approximate inference
      in spatial-temporal settings, and their use in decadal climate prediction.'

    abstract: Gaussian processes (GPs) are important probabilistic tools for inference
      and learning in spatio-temporal modelling problems such as those in climate
      science and epidemiology. However, existing GP approximations do not simultaneously
      support large numbers of off-the-grid spatial data-points and long time-series
      which is a hallmark of many applications. Pseudo-point approximations, one of
      the gold-standard methods for scaling GPs to large data sets, are well suited
      for handling off-the-grid spatial data. However, they cannot handle long temporal
      observation horizons effectively reverting to cubic computational scaling in
      the time dimension. State space GP approximations are well suited to handling
      temporal data, if the temporal GP prior admits a Markov form, leading to linear
      complexity in the number of temporal observations, but have a cubic spatial
      cost and cannot handle off-the-grid spatial data. In this work we show that
      there is a simple and elegant way to combine pseudo-point methods with the state
      space GP approximation framework to get the best of both worlds. The approach
      hinges on a surprising conditional independence property which applies to space–time
      separable GPs. We demonstrate empirically that the combined approach is more
      scalable and applicable to a greater range of spatio-temporal problems than
      either method on its own.

      this paper we derive a stick-breaking representation for the IBP. Based on this
      new representation, we develop slice samplers for the IBP that are efficient,
      easy to implement and are more generally applicable than the currently available
      Gibbs sampler. This representation, along with the work of Thibaux and Jordan,
      also illuminates interesting theoretical connections between the IBP, Chinese
      restaurant processes, Beta processes and Dirichlet processes.

    abstract: 'We consider distributed optimization under communication constraints
      for training deep learning models. We propose a new algorithm, whose parameter
      updates rely on two forces: a regular gradient step, and a corrective direction
      dictated by the currently best-performing worker (leader). Our method differs
      from the parameter-averaging scheme EASGD in a number of ways: (i) our objective
      formulation does not change the location of stationary points compared to the
      original optimization problem; (ii) we avoid convergence decelerations caused
      by pulling local workers descending to different local minima to each other
      (i.e. to the average of their parameters); (iii) our update by design breaks
      the curse of symmetry (the phenomenon of being trapped in poorly generalizing
      sub-optimal solutions in symmetric non-convex landscapes); and (iv) our approach
      is more communication efficient since it broadcasts only parameters of the leader
      rather than all workers. We provide theoretical analysis of the batch version
      of the proposed algorithm, which we call Leader Gradient Descent (LGD), and
      its stochastic variant (LSGD). Finally, we implement an asynchronous version
      of our algorithm and extend it to the multi-leader setting, where we form groups
      of workers, each represented by its own local leader (the best performer in
      a group), and update each worker with a corrective direction comprised of two
      attractive forces: one to the local, and one to the global leader (the best
      performer among all workers). The multi-leader setting is well-aligned with
      current hardware architecture, where local workers forming a group lie within
      a single computational node and different groups correspond to different nodes.
      For training convolutional neural networks, we empirically demonstrate that
      our approach compares favorably to state-of-the-art baselines.'

    abstract: As Gaussian processes mature, they are increasingly being deployed as
      part of larger machine learning and decision-making systems, for instance in
      geospatial modeling, Bayesian optimization, or in latent Gaussian models. Within
      a system, the Gaussian process model needs to perform in a stable and reliable
      manner to ensure it interacts correctly with other parts the system. In this
      work, we study the numerical stability of scalable sparse approximations based
      on inducing points. We derive sufficient and in certain cases necessary conditions
      on the inducing points for the computations performed to be numerically stable.
      For low-dimensional tasks such as geospatial modeling, we propose an automated
      method for computing inducing points satisfying these conditions. This is done
      via a modification of the cover tree data structure, which is of independent
      interest. We additionally propose an alternative sparse approximation for regression
      with a Gaussian likelihood which trades off a small amount of performance to
      further improve stability. We evaluate the proposed techniques on a number of
      examples, showing that, in geospatial settings, sparse approximations with guaranteed
      numerical stability often perform comparably to those without.

    abstract: This paper describes a scalable algorithm for the simultaneous mapping
      and localization (SLAM) problem. SLAM is the problem of acquiring a map of a
      static environment with a mobile robot. The vast majority of SLAM algorithms
      are based on the extended Kalman filter (EKF). This paper advocates an algorithm
      that relies on the dual of the EKF, the extended information filter (EIF). We
      show that when represented in the information form, map posteriors are dominated
      by a small number of links that tie together nearby features in the map. This
      insight is developed into a sparse variant of the EIF, called the sparse extended
      information filters (SEIF). SEIFs represent maps by graphical networks of features
      that are locally interconnected, where links represent relative information
      between pairs of nearby features, as well as information about the robot's pose
      relative to the map. We show that all essential update equations in SEIFs can
      be executed in constant time, irrespective of the size of the map. We also provide
      empirical results obtained for a benchmark data set collected in an outdoor
      environment, and using a multi-robot mapping simulation.

    abstract: We introduce the Gaussian Process Convolution Model (GPCM), a two-stage
      nonparametric generative procedure to model stationary signals as the convolution
      between a continuous-time white-noise process and a continuous-time linear filter
      drawn from Gaussian process. The GPCM is a continuous-time nonparametricwindow
      moving average process and, conditionally, is itself a Gaussian process with
      a nonparametric kernel defined in a probabilistic fashion. The generative model
      can be equivalently considered in the frequency domain, where the power spectral
      density of the signal is specified using a Gaussian process. One of the main
      contributions of the paper is to develop a novel variational freeenergy approach
      based on inter-domain inducing variables that efficiently learns the continuous-time
      linear filter and infers the driving white-noise process. In turn, this scheme
      provides closed-form probabilistic estimates of the covariance kernel and the
      noise-free signal both in denoising and prediction scenarios. Additionally,
      the variational inference procedure provides closed-form expressions for the
      approximate posterior of the spectral density given the observed data, leading
      to new Bayesian nonparametric approaches to spectrum estimation. The proposed
      GPCM is validated using synthetic and real-world signals.

    abstract: A novel framework for the design of state-space models (SSMs) is proposed
      whereby the state-transition function of the model is parametrized using reproducing
      kernels. The nature of SSMs requires learning a latent function that resides
      in the state space and for which input-output sample pairs are not available,
      thus prohibiting the use of gradient-based supervised kernel learning. To this
      end, we then propose to learn the mixing weights of the kernel estimate by sampling
      from their posterior density using Monte Carlo methods. We first introduce an
      offline version of the proposed algorithm, followed by an online version which
      performs inference on both the parameters and the hidden state through particle
      filtering. The accuracy of the estimation of the state-transition function is
      first validated on synthetic data. Next, we show that the proposed algorithm
      outperforms kernel adaptive filters in the prediction of real-world time series,
      while also providing probabilistic estimates, a key advantage over standard
      methods.

    abstract: Quaternion reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (QRKHS) have been proposed
      recently and provide a high-dimensional feature space (alternative to the real-valued
      multikernel approach) for general kernel-learning applications. The current
      challenge within quaternion-kernel learning is the lack of general quaternion-valued
      kernels, which are necessary to exploit the full advantages of the QRKHS theory
      in real-world problems. This letter proposes a novel way to design quaternion-valued
      kernels, this is achieved by transforming three complex kernels into quaternion
      ones and then combining their real and imaginary parts. Building on this general
      construction, our emphasis is on a new quaternion kernel of polynomial features,
      which is assessed in the prediction of bodysensor networks applications.

    abstract: In complex-valued signal processing, estimation algorithms require complete
      knowledge (or accurate estimation) of the second order statistics, this makes
      Gaussian processes (GP) well suited for modelling complex signals, as they are
      designed in terms of covariance functions. Dealing with bivariate signals using
      GPs require four covariance matrices, or equivalently, two complex matrices.
      We propose a GP-based approach for modelling complex signals, whereby the second-order
      statistics are learnt through maximum likelihood; in particular, the complex
      GP approach allows for circularity coefficient estimation in a robust manner
      when the observed signal is corrupted by (circular) white noise. The proposed
      model is validated using climate signals, for both circular and noncircular
      cases. The results obtained open new possibilities for collaboration between
      the complex signal processing and Gaussian processes communities towards an
      appealing representation and statistical description of bivariate signals.

    abstract: 'Many visual datasets are traditionally used to analyze the performance
      of different learning techniques. The evaluation is usually done within each
      dataset, therefore it is questionable if such results are a reliable indicator
      of true generalization ability. We propose here an algorithm to exploit the
      existing data resources when learning on a new multiclass problem. Our main
      idea is to identify an image representation that decomposes orthogonally into
      two subspaces: a part specific to each dataset, and a part generic to, and therefore
      shared between, all the considered source sets. This allows us to use the generic
      representation as un-biased reference knowledge for a novel classification task.
      By casting the method in the multi-view setting, we also make it possible to
      use different features for different databases. We call the algorithm MUST,
      Multitask Unaligned Shared knowledge Transfer. Through extensive experiments
      on five public datasets, we show that MUST consistently improves the cross-datasets
      generalization performance.'

    abstract: 'Causal discovery and causal reasoning are classically treated as separate
      and consecutive tasks: one first infers the causal graph, and then uses it to
      estimate causal effects of interventions. However, such a two-stage approach
      is uneconomical, especially in terms of actively collected interventional data,
      since the causal query of interest may not require a fully-specified causal
      model. From a Bayesian perspective, it is also unnatural, since a causal query
      (e.g., the causal graph or some causal effect) can be viewed as a latent quantity
      subject to posterior inference – other unobserved quantities that are not of
      direct interest (e.g., the full causal model) ought to be marginalized out in
      this process and contribute to our epistemic uncertainty. In this work, we propose
      Active Bayesian Causal Inference (ABCI), a fully-Bayesian active learning framework
      for integrated causal discovery and reasoning, which jointly infers a posterior
      over causal models and queries of interest. In our approach to ABCI, we focus
      on the class of causally-sufficient, nonlinear additive noise models, which
      we model using Gaussian processes. We sequentially design experiments that are
      maximally informative about our target causal query, collect the corresponding
      interventional data, and update our beliefs to choose the next experiment. Through
      simulations, we demonstrate that our approach is more data-efficient than several
      baselines that only focus on learning the full causal graph. This allows us
      to accurately learn downstream causal queries from fewer samples while providing
      well-calibrated uncertainty estimates for the quantities of interest.'

    abstract: In several domains obtaining class annotations is expensive while at
      the same time unlabelled data are abundant. While most semi-supervised approaches
      enforce restrictive assumptions on the data distribution, recent work has managed
      to learn semi-supervised models in a non-restrictive regime. However, so far
      such approaches have only been proposed for linear models. In this work, we
      introduce semi-supervised parameter learning for Sum-Product Networks (SPNs).
      SPNs are deep probabilistic models admitting inference in linear time in number
      of network edges. Our approach has several advantages, as it (1) allows generative
      and discriminative semi-supervised learning, (2) guarantees that adding unlabelled
      data can increase, but not degrade, the performance (safe), and (3) is computationally
      efficient and does not enforce restrictive assumptions on the data distribution.
      We show on a variety of data sets that safe semi-supervised learning with SPNs
      is competitive compared to state-of-the-art and can lead to a better generative
      and discriminative objective value than a purely supervised approach.

    abstract: 'Sum-product networks (SPNs) are flexible density estimators and have
      received significant attention due to their attractive inference properties.
      While parameter learning in SPNs is well developed, structure learning leaves
      something to be desired: Even though there is a plethora of SPN structure learners,
      most of them are somewhat ad-hoc and based on intuition rather than a clear
      learning principle. In this paper, we introduce a well-principled Bayesian framework
      for SPN structure learning. First, we decompose the problem into i) laying out
      a computational graph, and ii) learning the so-called scope function over the
      graph. The first is rather unproblematic and akin to neural network architecture
      validation. The second represents the effective structure of the SPN and needs
      to respect the usual structural constraints in SPN, i.e. completeness and decomposability.
      While representing and learning the scope function is somewhat involved in general,
      in this paper, we propose a natural parametrisation for an important and widely
      used special case of SPNs. These structural parameters are incorporated into
      a Bayesian model, such that simultaneous structure and parameter learning is
      cast into monolithic Bayesian posterior inference. In various experiments, our
      Bayesian SPNs often improve test likelihoods over greedy SPN learners. Further,
      since the Bayesian framework protects against overfitting, we can evaluate hyper-parameters
      directly on the Bayesian model score, waiving the need for a separate validation
      set, which is especially beneficial in low data regimes. Bayesian SPNs can be
      applied to heterogeneous domains and can easily be extended to nonparametric
      formulations. Moreover, our Bayesian approach is the first, which consistently
      and robustly learns SPN structures under missing data.'

    abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) are powerful non-parametric Bayesian regression
      models that allow exact posterior inference, but exhibit high computational
      and memory costs. In order to improve scalability of GPs, approximate posterior
      inference is frequently employed, where a prominent class of approximation techniques
      is based on local GP experts. However, local-expert techniques proposed so far
      are either not well-principled, come with limited approximation guarantees,
      or lead to intractable models. In this paper, we introduce deep structured mixtures
      of GP experts, a stochastic process model which i) allows exact posterior inference,
      ii) has attractive computational and memory costs, and iii) when used as GP
      approximation, captures predictive uncertainties consistently better than previous
      expert-based approximations. In a variety of experiments, we show that deep
      structured mixtures have a low approximation error and often perform competitive
      or outperform prior work.

    abstract: 'When machine learning systems meet real world applications, accuracy
      is only one of several requirements. In this paper, we assay a complementary
      perspective originating from the increasing availability of pre-trained and
      regularly improving state-of-the-art models. While new improved models develop
      at a fast pace, downstream tasks vary more slowly or stay constant. Assume that
      we have a large unlabelled data set for which we want to maintain accurate predictions.
      Whenever a new and presumably better ML models becomes available, we encounter
      two problems: (i) given a limited budget, which data points should be re-evaluated
      using the new model?; and (ii) if the new predictions differ from the current
      ones, should we update? Problem (i) is about compute cost, which matters for
      very large data sets and models. Problem (ii) is about maintaining consistency
      of the predictions, which can be highly relevant for downstream applications;
      our demand is to avoid negative flips, i.e., changing correct to incorrect predictions.
      In this paper, we formalize the Prediction Update Problem and present an efficient
      probabilistic approach as answer to the above questions. In extensive experiments
      on standard classification benchmark data sets, we show that our method outperforms
      alternative strategies along key metrics for backward-compatible prediction
      updates.'

    abstract: De novo drug design has recently received increasing attention from
      the machine learning community. It is important that the field is aware of the
      actual goals and challenges of drug design and the roles that de novo molecule
      design algorithms could play in accelerating the process, so that algorithms
      can be evaluated in a way that reflects how they would be applied in real drug
      design scenarios. In this paper, we propose a framework for critically assessing
      the merits of benchmarks, and argue that most of the existing de novo drug design
      benchmark functions are either highly unrealistic or depend upon a surrogate
      model whose performance is not well characterized. In order for the field to
      achieve its long-term goals, we recommend that poor benchmarks (especially logP
      and QED) be deprecated in favour of better benchmarks. We hope that our proposed
      framework can play a part in developing new de novo drug design benchmarks that
      are more realistic and ideally incorporate the intrinsic goals of drug design.

    abstract: Infinite Hidden Markov Models (iHMM’s) are an attractive, nonparametric
      gener- alization of the classical Hidden Markov Model which can automatically
      infer the number of hidden states in the system. However, due to the infinite-dimensional
      nature of the transition dynamics, performing inference in the iHMM is difficult.
      In this paper, we present an infinite-state Particle Gibbs (PG) algorithm to
      re- sample state trajectories for the iHMM. The proposed algorithm uses an efficient
      proposal optimized for iHMMs and leverages ancestor sampling to improve the
      mixing of the standard PG algorithm. Our algorithm demonstrates significant
      con- vergence improvements on synthetic and real world data sets.

    abstract: Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) exploits Hamiltonian dynamics to construct
      efficient proposals for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). In this paper, we present
      a generalization of HMC which exploits non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics. We
      refer to this algorithm as magnetic HMC, since in 3 dimensions a subset of the
      dynamics map onto the mechanics of a charged particle coupled to a magnetic
      field. We establish a theoretical basis for the use of non-canonical Hamiltonian
      dynamics in MCMC, and construct a symplectic, leapfrog-like integrator allowing
      for the implementation of magnetic HMC. Finally, we exhibit several examples
      where these non-canonical dynamics can lead to improved mixing of magnetic HMC
      relative to ordinary HMC.

    abstract: It is important to understand the rich structure of natural sounds in
      order to solve important tasks, like automatic speech recognition, and to understand
      auditory processing in the brain. This thesis takes a step in this direction
      by characterising the statistics of simple natural sounds. We focus on the statistics
      because perception often appears to depend on them, rather than on the raw waveform.
      For example the perception of auditory textures, like running water, wind, fire
      and rain, depends on summary-statistics, like the rate of falling rain droplets,
      rather than on the exact details of the physical source. In order to analyse
      the statistics of sounds accurately it is necessary to improve a number of traditional
      signal processing methods, including those for amplitude demodulation, time-frequency
      analysis, and sub-band demodulation. These estimation tasks are ill-posed and
      therefore it is natural to treat them as Bayesian inference problems. The new
      probabilistic versions of these methods have several advantages. For example,
      they perform more accurately on natural signals and are more robust to noise,
      they can also fill-in missing sections of data, and provide error-bars. Furthermore,
      free-parameters can be learned from the signal. Using these new algorithms we
      demonstrate that the energy, sparsity, modulation depth and modulation time-scale
      in each sub-band of a signal are critical statistics, together with the dependencies
      between the sub-band modulators. In order to validate this claim, a model containing
      co-modulated coloured noise carriers is shown to be capable of generating a
      range of realistic sounding auditory textures. Finally, we explored the connection
      between the statistics of natural sounds and perception. We demonstrate that
      inference in the model for auditory textures qualitatively replicates the primitive
      grouping rules that listeners use to understand simple acoustic scenes. This
      suggests that the auditory system is optimised for the statistics of natural
      sounds.

    abstract: 'This thesis details several applications of Gaussian processes (GPs)
      for enhanced time series modeling. We first cover different approaches for using
      Gaussian processes in time series problems. These are extended to the state
      space approach to time series in two different problems. We also combine Gaussian
      processes and Bayesian online change point detection (BOCPD) to increase the
      generality of the Gaussian process time series methods. These methodologies
      are evaluated on predictive performance on six real world data sets, which include
      three environmental data sets, one financial, one biological, and one from industrial
      well drilling.<br> Gaussian processes are capable of generalizing standard linear
      time series models. We cover two approaches: the Gaussian process time series
      model (GPTS) and the autoregressive Gaussian process (ARGP). We cover a variety
      of methods that greatly reduce the computational and memory complexity of Gaussian
      process approaches, which are generally cubic in computational complexity.<br>
      Two different improvements to state space based approaches are covered. First,
      Gaussian process inference and learning (GPIL) generalizes linear dynamical
      systems (LDS), for which the Kalman filter is based, to general nonlinear systems
      for nonparametric system identification. Second, we address pathologies in the
      unscented Kalman filter (UKF). We use Gaussian process optimization (GPO) to
      learn UKF settings that minimize the potential for sigma point collapse.<br>
      We show how to embed mentioned Gaussian process approaches to time series into
      a change point framework. Old data, from an old regime, that hinders predictive
      performance is automatically and elegantly phased out. The computational improvements
      for Gaussian process time series approaches are of even greater use in the change
      point framework. We also present a supervised framework learning a change point
      model when change point labels are available in training.<br> These mentioned
      methodologies significantly improve predictive performance on the diverse set
      of data sets selected.'

      can result in a significant increase in predictive performance over default
      settings of the parameters in the UKF and other filters designed to avoid the
      problems of the UKF, such as the GP-ADF. At the same time, we maintain a lower
      computational complexity than the other methods. We call our method UKF-L.

    abstract: Real-world time series are often nonstationary with respect to the parameters
      of some underlying prediction model (UPM). Furthermore, it is often desirable
      to adapt the UPM to incoming regime changes as soon as possible, necessitating
      sequential inference about change point locations. A Bayesian algorithm for
      online change point detection (BOCPD) has been introduced recently by Adams
      and MacKay (2007). In this algorithm, uncertainty about the last change point
      location is updated sequentially, and is integrated out to make online predictions
      robust to parameter changes. BOCPD requires a set of fixed hyper-parameters
      which allow the user to fully specify the hazard function for change points
      and the prior distribution over the parameters of the UPM. In practice, finding
      the "right" hyper-parameters can be quite difficult. We therefore extend BOCPD
      by introducing hyper-parameter learning, without sacrificing the online nature
      of the algorithm. Hyper-parameter learning is performed by optimizing the marginal
      likelihood of the BOCPD model, a closed-form quantity which can be computed
      sequentially. We illustrate performance on three real-world datasets.

    abstract: Auditory scene analysis is extremely challenging. One approach, perhaps
      that adopted by the brain, is to shape useful representations of sounds on prior
      knowledge about their statistical structure. For example, sounds with harmonic
      sections are common and so time-frequency representations are efficient. Most
      current representations concentrate on the shorter components. Here, we propose
      representations for structures on longer time-scales, like the phonemes and
      sentences of speech. We decompose a sound into a product of processes, each
      with its own characteristic time-scale. This demodulation cascade relates to
      classical amplitude demodulation, but traditional algorithms fail to realise
      the representation fully. A new approach, probabilistic amplitude demodulation,
      is shown to out-perform the established methods, and to easily extend to representation
      of a full demodulation cascade.

    abstract: 'Natural sounds are structured on many time-scales. A typical segment
      of speech, for example, contains features that span four orders of magnitude:
      Sentences (∼1s); phonemes (∼10−1 s); glottal pulses (∼ 10−2s); and formants
      (∼ 10−3s). The auditory system uses information from each of these time-scales
      to solve complicated tasks such as auditory scene analysis [1]. One route toward
      understanding how auditory processing accomplishes this analysis is to build
      neuroscience-inspired algorithms which solve similar tasks and to compare the
      properties of these algorithms with properties of auditory processing. There
      is however a discord: Current machine-audition algorithms largely concentrate
      on the shorter time-scale structures in sounds, and the longer structures are
      ignored. The reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, it is a difficult technical
      problem to construct an algorithm that utilises both sorts of information. Secondly,
      it is computationally demanding to simultaneously process data both at high
      resolution (to extract short temporal information) and for long duration (to
      extract long temporal information). The contribution of this work is to develop
      a new statistical model for natural sounds that captures structure across a
      wide range of time-scales, and to provide efficient learning and inference algorithms.
      We demonstrate the success of this approach on a missing data task.'

    abstract: Amplitude demodulation is an ill-posed problem and so it is natural
      to treat it from a Bayesian viewpoint, inferring the most likely carrier and
      envelope under probabilistic constraints. One such treatment is Probabilistic
      Amplitude Demodulation (PAD), which, whilst computationally more intensive than
      traditional approaches, offers several advantages. Here we provide methods for
      estimating the uncertainty in the PAD-derived envelopes and carriers, and for
      learning free-parameters like the time-scale of the envelope. We show how the
      probabilistic approach can naturally handle noisy and missing data. Finally,
      we indicate how to extend the model to signals which contain multiple modulators
      and carriers.

    abstract: Variational methods are a key component of the approximate inference
      and learning toolbox. These methods fill an important middle ground, retaining
      distributional information about uncertainty in latent variables, unlike maximum
      a posteriori methods (MAP), and yet generally requiring less computational time
      than Monte Carlo Markov Chain methods. In particular the variational Expectation
      Maximisation (vEM) and variational Bayes algorithms, both involving variational
      optimisation of a free-energy, are widely used in time-series modelling. Here,
      we investigate the success of vEM in simple probabilistic time-series models.
      First we consider the inference step of vEM, and show that a consequence of
      the well-known compactness property of variational inference is a failure to
      propagate uncertainty in time, thus limiting the usefulness of the retained
      distributional information. In particular, the uncertainty may appear to be
      smallest precisely when the approximation is poorest. Second, we consider parameter
      learning and analytically reveal systematic biases in the parameters found by
      vEM. Surprisingly, simpler variational approximations (such a mean-field) can
      lead to less bias than more complicated structured approximations.

    abstract: 'Demodulation is an ill-posed problem whenever both carrier and envelope
      signals are broadband and unknown. Here, we approach this problem using the
      methods of probabilistic inference. The new approach, called Probabilistic Amplitude
      Demodulation (PAD), is computationally challenging but improves on existing
      methods in a number of ways. By contrast to previous approaches to demodulation,
      it satisfies five key desiderata: PAD has soft constraints because it is probabilistic;
      PAD is able to automatically adjust to the signal because it learns parameters;
      PAD is user-steerable because the solution can be shaped by user-specific prior
      information; PAD is robust to broad-band noise because this is modelled explicitly;
      and PAD’s solution is self-consistent, empirically satisfying a Carrier Identity
      property. Furthermore, the probabilistic view naturally encompasses noise and
      uncertainty, allowing PAD to cope with missing data and return error bars on
      carrier and envelope estimates. Finally, we show that when PAD is applied to
      a bandpass-filtered signal, the stop-band energy of the inferred carrier is
      minimal, making PAD well-suited to sub-band demodulation.'

    abstract: A number of recent scientific and engineering problems require signals
      to be decomposed into a product of a slowly varying positive envelope and a
      quickly varying carrier whose instantaneous frequency also varies slowly over
      time. Although signal processing provides algorithms for so-called amplitude-
      and frequency-demodulation (AFD), there are well known problems with all of
      the existing methods. Motivated by the fact that AFD is ill-posed, we approach
      the problem using probabilistic inference. The new approach, called probabilistic
      amplitude and frequency demodulation (PAFD), models instantaneous frequency
      using an auto-regressive generalization of the von Mises distribution, and the
      envelopes using Gaussian auto-regressive dynamics with a positivity constraint.
      A novel form of expectation propagation is used for inference. We demonstrate
      that although PAFD is computationally demanding, it outperforms previous approaches
      on synthetic and real signals in clean, noisy and missing data settings.

    abstract: There are many methods for decomposing signals into a sum of amplitude
      and frequency modulated sinusoids. In this paper we take a new estimation based
      approach. Identifying the problem as ill-posed, we show how to regularize the
      solution by imposing soft constraints on the amplitude and phase variables of
      the sinusoids. Estimation proceeds using a version of Kalman smoothing. We evaluate
      the method on synthetic and natural, clean and noisy signals, showing that it
      outperforms previous decompositions, but at a higher computational cost.

    abstract: The brain extracts useful features from a maelstrom of sensory information,
      and a fundamental goal of theoretical neuroscience is to work out how it does
      so. One proposed feature extraction strategy is motivated by the observation
      that the meaning of sensory data, such as the identity of a moving visual object,
      is often more persistent than the activation of any single sensory receptor.
      This notion is embodied in the slow feature analysis (SFA) algorithm, which
      uses “slowness” as an heuristic by which to extract semantic information from
      multi-dimensional time-series. Here, we develop a probabilistic interpretation
      of this algorithm showing that inference and learning in the limiting case of
      a suitable probabilistic model yield exactly the results of SFA. Similar equivalences
      have proved useful in interpreting and extending comparable algorithms such
      as independent component analysis. For SFA, we use the equivalent probabilistic
      model as a conceptual spring-board, with which to motivate several novel extensions
      to the algorithm.

    abstract: When learning a mixture model, we suffer from the local optima and model
      structure determination problems. In this paper, we present a method for simultaneously
      solving these problems based on the variational Bayesian (VB) framework. First,
      in the VB framework, we derive an objective function that can simultaneously
      optimize both model parameter distributions and model structure. Next, focusing
      on mixture models, we present a deterministic algorithm to approximately optimize
      the objective function by using the idea of the split and merge operations which
      we previously proposed within the maximum likelihood framework. Then, we apply
      the method to mixture of expers (MoE) models to experimentally show that the
      proposed method can find the optimal number of experts of a MoE while avoiding
      local maxima. q 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

    abstract: We present a split-and-merge expectation-maximization (SMEM) algorithm

    abstract: The infinite hidden Markov model is a non-parametric extension of the
      widely used hidden Markov model. Our paper introduces a new inference algorithm
      for the infinite Hidden Markov model called beam sampling. Beam sampling combines
      slice sampling, which limits the number of states considered at each time step
      to a finite number, with dynamic programming, which samples whole state trajectories
      efficiently. Our algorithm typically outperforms the Gibbs sampler and is more
      robust. We present applications of iHMM inference using the beam sampler on
      changepoint detection and text prediction problems.

    abstract: The infinite factorial hidden Markov model is a non-parametric extension
      of the factorial hidden Markov model. Our model defines a probability distribution
      over an infinite number of independent binary hidden Markov chains which together
      produce an observable sequence of random variables. Central to our model is
      a new type of non-parametric prior distribution inspired by the Indian Buffet
      Process which we call the Indian Buffet Markov Process.

    abstract: We extend previous work on fully unsupervised part-of-speech tagging.
      Using a non-parametric version of the HMM, called the infinite HMM (iHMM), we
      address the problem of choosing the number of hidden states in unsupervised
      Markov models for PoS tagging. We experiment with two non-parametric priors,
      the Dirichlet and Pitman-Yor processes, on the Wall Street Journal dataset using
      a parallelized implementation of an iHMM inference algorithm. We evaluate the
      results with a variety of clustering evaluation metrics and achieve equivalent
      or better performances than previously reported. Building on this promising
      result we evaluate the output of the unsupervised PoS tagger as a direct replacement
      for the output of a fully supervised PoS tagger for the task of shallow parsing
      and compare the two evaluations.

    abstract: The crosslingual link detection problem calls for identifying news articles
      in multiple languages that report on the same news event. This paper presents
      a novel approach based on constrained clustering. We discuss a general way for
      constrained clustering using a recent, graph-based clustering framework called
      correlation clustering. We introduce a correlation clustering implementation
      that features linear program chunking to allow processing larger datasets. We
      show how to apply the correlation clustering algorithm to the crosslingual link
      detection problem and present experimental results that show correlation clustering
      improves upon the hierarchical clustering approaches commonly used in link detection,
      and, hierarchical clustering approaches that take constraints into account.

    abstract: 'Abstract Sum-Product Networks (SPNs) are a deep probabilistic architecture
      that up to now has been successfully employed for tractable inference. Here,
      we extend their scope towards unsupervised representation learning: we encode
      samples into continuous and categorical embeddings and show that they can also
      be decoded back into the original input space by leveraging MPE inference. We
      characterize when this Sum-Product Autoencoding (SPAE) leads to equivalent reconstructions
      and extend it towards dealing with missing embedding information. Our experimental
      results on several multilabel classification problems demonstrate that SPAE
      is competitive with state-of-the-art autoencoder architectures, even if the
      SPNs were never trained to reconstruct their inputs.'

    abstract: 'End-to-End training (E2E) is becoming more and more popular to train
      complex Deep Network architectures. An interesting question is whether this
      trend will continue—are there any clear failure cases for E2E training? We study
      this question in depth, for the specific case of E2E training an ensemble of
      networks. Our strategy is to blend the gradient smoothly in between two extremes:
      from independent training of the networks, up to to full E2E training. We find
      clear failure cases, where overparameterized models cannot be trained E2E. A
      surprising result is that the optimum can sometimes lie in between the two,
      neither an ensemble or an E2E system. The work also uncovers links to Dropout,
      and raises questions around the nature of ensemble diversity and multi-branch
      networks.'

    abstract: A recent, promising approach to identifying a configuration of a discrete
      graphical model with highest probability (termed MAP inference) is to reduce
      the problem to finding a maximum weight stable set (MWSS) in a derived weighted
      graph, which, if perfect, allows a solution to be found in polynomial time.
      Weller and Jebara (2013) investigated the class of binary pairwise models where
      this method may be applied. However, their analysis made a seemingly innocuous
      assumption which simplifies analysis but led to only a subset of possible reparameterizations
      being considered. Here we introduce novel techniques and consider all cases,
      demonstrating that this greatly expands the set of tractable models. We provide
      a simple, exact characterization of the new, enlarged set and show how such
      models may be efficiently identified, thus settling the power of the approach
      on this class.

    abstract: For undirected graphical models, belief propagation often performs remarkably
      well for approximate marginal inference, and may be viewed as a heuristic to
      minimize the Bethe free energy. Focusing on binary pairwise models, we demonstrate
      that several recent results on the Bethe approximation may be generalized to
      a broad family of related pairwise free energy approximations with arbitrary
      counting numbers. We explore approximation error and shed light on the empirical
      success of the Bethe approximation.

    abstract: We show how any binary pairwise model may be ‘uprooted’ to a fully symmetric
      model, wherein original singleton potentials are transformed to potentials on
      edges to an added variable, and then ‘rerooted’ to a new model on the original
      number of variables. The new model is essentially equivalent to the original
      model, with the same partition function and allowing recovery of the original
      marginals or a MAP configuration, yet may have very different computational
      properties that allow much more efficient inference. This meta-approach deepens
      our understanding, may be applied to any existing algorithm to yield improved
      methods in practice, generalizes earlier theoretical results, and reveals a
      remarkable interpretation of the triplet-consistent polytope.

    abstract: We consider binary pairwise graphical models and provide an exact characterization
      (necessary and sufficient conditions observing signs of potentials) of tightness
      for the LP relaxation on the triplet-consistent polytope of the MAP inference
      problem, by forbidding an odd-K5 (complete graph on 5 variables with all edges
      repulsive) as a signed minor in the signed suspension graph. This captures signs
      of both singleton and edge potentials in a compact and efficiently testable
      condition, and improves significantly on earlier results. We provide other results
      on tightness of LP relaxations by forbidding minors, draw connections and suggest
      paths for future research.

    abstract: We examine the effect of clamping variables for approximate inference
      in undirected graphical models with pairwise relationships and discrete variables.
      For any number of variable labels, we demonstrate that clamping and summing
      approximate sub-partition functions can lead only to a decrease in the partition
      function estimate for TRW, and an increase for the naive mean field method,
      in each case guaranteeing an improvement in the approximation and bound. We
      next focus on binary variables, add the Bethe approximation to consideration
      and examine ways to choose good variables to clamp, introducing new methods.
      We show the importance of identifying highly frustrated cycles, and of checking
      the singleton entropy of a variable. We explore the value of our methods by
      empirical analysis and draw lessons to guide practitioners.

    abstract: It was recently proved using graph covers (Ruozzi, 2012) that the Bethe
      partition function is upper bounded by the true partition function for a binary
      pairwise model that is attractive. Here we provide a new, arguably simpler proof
      from first principles. We make use of the idea of clamping a variable to a particular
      value. For an attractive model, we show that summing over the Bethe partition
      functions for each sub-model obtained after clamping any variable can only raise
      (and hence improve) the approximation. In fact, we derive a stronger result
      that may have other useful implications. Repeatedly clamping until we obtain
      a model with no cycles, where the Bethe approximation is exact, yields the result.
      We also provide a related lower bound on a broad class of approximate partition
      functions of general pairwise multi-label models that depends only on the topology.
      We demonstrate that clamping a few wisely chosen variables can be of practical
      value by dramatically reducing approximation error.

    abstract: Linear programming (LP) relaxations are widely used to attempt to identify
      a most likely configuration of a discrete graphical model. In some cases, the
      LP relaxation attains an optimum vertex at an integral location and thus guarantees
      an exact solution to the original optimization problem. When this occurs, we
      say that the LP relaxation is tight. Here we consider binary pairwise models
      and derive sufﬁcient conditions for guaranteed tightness of (i) the standard
      LP relaxation on the local polytope LP+LOC, and (ii) the LP relaxation on the
      triplet-consistent polytope LP+TRI (the next level in the Sherali-Adams hierarchy).
      We provide simple new proofs of earlier results and derive signiﬁcant novel
      results including that LP+TRI is tight for any model where each block is balanced
      or almost balanced, and a decomposition theorem that may be used to break apart
      complex models into smaller pieces. An almost balanced (sub-)model is one that
      contains no frustrated cycles except through one privileged variable.

    abstract: 'Truly intelligent systems are capable of pattern discovery and extrapolation
      without human intervention. Bayesian nonparametric models, which can uniquely
      represent expressive prior information and detailed inductive biases, provide
      a distinct opportunity to develop intelligent systems, with applications in
      essentially any learning and prediction task.<br> Gaussian processes are rich
      distributions over functions, which provide a Bayesian nonparametric approach
      to smoothing and interpolation. A covariance kernel determines the support and
      inductive biases of a Gaussian process. In this thesis, we introduce new covariance
      kernels to enable fast automatic pattern discovery and extrapolation with Gaussian
      processes.<br> In the introductory chapter, we discuss the high level principles
      behind all of the models in this thesis: 1) we can typically improve the predictive
      performance of a model by accounting for additional structure in data; 2) to
      automatically discover rich structure in data, a model must have large support
      and the appropriate inductive biases; 3) we most need expressive models for
      large datasets, which typically provide more information for learning structure,
      and 4) we can often exploit the existing inductive biases (assumptions) or structure
      of a model for scalable inference, without the need for simplifying assumptions.<br>
      In the context of this introduction, we then discuss, in chapter 2, Gaussian
      processes as kernel machines, and my views on the future of Gaussian process
      research.<br> In chapter 3 we introduce the Gaussian process regression network
      (GPRN) framework, a multi-output Gaussian process method which scales to many
      output variables, and accounts for input-dependent correlations between the
      outputs. Underlying the GPRN is a highly expressive kernel, formed using an
      adaptive mixture of latent basis functions in a neural network like architecture.
      The GPRN is capable of discovering expressive structure in data. We use the
      GPRN to model the time-varying expression levels of 1000 genes, the spatially
      varying concentrations of several distinct heavy metals, and multivariate volatility
      (input dependent noise covariances) between returns on equity indices and currency
      exchanges, which is particularly valuable for portfolio allocation. We generalise
      the GPRN to an adaptive network framework, which does not depend on Gaussian
      processes or Bayesian nonparametrics; and we outline applications for the adaptive
      network in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, ensemble learning,
      and change-point modelling.<br> In chapter 4 we introduce simple closed form
      kernel for automatic pattern discovery and extrapolation. These spectral mixture
      (SM) kernels are derived by modelling the spectral densiy of a kernel (its Fourier
      transform) using a scale-location Gaussian mixture. SM kernels form a basis
      for all stationary covariances, and can be used as a drop-in replacement for
      standard kernels, as they retain simple and exact learning and inference procedures.
      We use the SM kernel to discover patterns and perform long range extrapolation
      on atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data, as well as on synthetic
      examples. We also show that the SM kernel can be used to automatically reconstruct
      several standard covariances. The SM kernel and the GPRN are highly complementary;
      we show that using the SM kernel with adaptive basis functions in a GPRN induces
      an expressive prior over non-stationary kernels.<br> In chapter 5 we introduce
      GPatt, a method for fast multidimensional pattern extrapolation, particularly
      suited to imge and movie data. Without human intervention – no hand crafting
      of kernel features, and no sophisticated initialisation procedures – we show
      that GPatt can solve large scale pattern extrapolation, inpainting and kernel
      discovery problems, including a problem with 383,400 training points. GPatt
      exploits the structure of a spectral mixture product (SMP) kernel, for fast
      yet exact inference procedures. We find that GPatt significantly outperforms
      popular alternative scalable gaussian process methods in speed and accuracy.
      Moreover, we discover profound differences between each of these methods, suggesting
      expressive kernels, nonparametric representations, and scalable inference which
      exploits existing model structure are useful in combination for modelling large
      scale multidimensional patterns.<br> The models in this dissertation have proven
      to be scalable and with greatly enhanced predictive performance over the alternatives:
      the extra structure being modelled is an important part of a wide variety of
      real data – including problems in econometrics, gene expression, geostatistics,
      nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, ensemble learning, multi-output regression,
      change point modelling, time series, multivariate volatility, image inpainting,
      texture extrapolation, video extrapolation, acoustic modelling, and kernel discovery.'

      The proposed kernels support a broad class of stationary covariances, but Gaussian

      by discovering patterns and performing long range extrapolation on synthetic
      examples, as well as atmospheric CO2 trends and airline passenger data. We also
      show that we can reconstruct standard covariances within our framework.

    abstract: We define a copula process which describes the dependencies between
      arbitrarily many random variables independently of their marginal distributions.
      As an example, we develop a stochastic volatility model, Gaussian Copula Process
      Volatility (GCPV), to predict the latent standard deviations of a sequence of
      random variables. To make predictions we use Bayesian inference, with the Laplace
      approximation, and with Markov chain Monte Carlo as an alternative. We find
      our model can outperform GARCH on simulated and financial data. And unlike GARCH,
      GCPV can easily handle missing data, incorporate covariates other than time,
      and model a rich class of covariance structures.

    abstract: Latent variable models represent hidden structure in observational data.
      To account for the distribution of the observational data changing over time,
      space or some other covariate, we need generalizations of latent variable models
      that explicitly capture this dependency on the covariate. A variety of such
      generalizations has been proposed for latent variable models based on the Dirichlet
      process. We address dependency on covariates in binary latent feature models,
      by introducing a dependent Indian Buffet Process. The model generates a binary
      random matrix with an unbounded number of columns for each value of the covariate.
      Evolution of the binary matrices over the covariate set is controlled by a hierarchical
      Gaussian process model. The choice of covariance functions controls the dependence
      structure and exchangeability properties of the model. We derive a Markov Chain
      Monte Carlo sampling algorithm for Bayesian inference, and provide experiments
      on both synthetic and real-world data. The experimental results show that explicit
      modeling of dependencies significantly improves accuracy of predictions.

    abstract: We present a practical way of introducing convolutional structure into
      Gaussian processes, making them more suited to high-dimensional inputs like
      images. The main contribution of our work is the construction of an inter-domain
      inducing point approximation that is well-tailored to the convolutional kernel.
      This allows us to gain the generalisation benefit of a convolutional kernel,
      together with fast but accurate posterior inference. We investigate several
      variations of the convolutional kernel, and apply it to MNIST and CIFAR-10,
      which have both been known to be challenging for Gaussian processes. We also
      show how the marginal likelihood can be used to find an optimal weighting between
      convolutional and RBF kernels to further improve performance. We hope that this
      illustration of the usefulness of a marginal likelihood will help automate discovering
      architectures in larger models.

    abstract: A number of methods for speeding up Gaussian Process (GP) prediction
      have been proposed, including the Nyström method of Williams and Seeger (2001).
      In this paper we focus on two issues (1) the relationship of the Nyström method
      to the Subset of Regressors method (Poggio and Girosi 1990; Luo and Wahba, 1997)
      and (2) understanding in what circumstances the Nyström approximation would
      be expected to provide a good approximation to exact GP regression.

    abstract: The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) is a Bayesian nonparametric
      mixed membership model — each data point is modeled with a collection of components
      of different proportions. Though powerful, the HDP makes an assumption that
      the probability of a component being exhibited by a data point is positively
      correlated with its proportion within that data point. This might be an undesirable
      assumption. For example, in topic modeling, a topic (component) might be rare
      throughout the corpus but dominant within those documents (data points) where
      it occurs. We develop the IBP compound Dirichlet process (ICD), a Bayesian nonparametric
      prior that decouples across-data prevalence and within-data proportion in a
      mixed membership model. The ICD combines properties from the HDP and the Indian
      buffet process (IBP), a Bayesian nonparametric prior on binary matrices. The
      ICD assigns a subset of the shared mixture components to each data point. This
      subset, the data point's "focus", is determined independently from the amount
      that each of its components contribute. We develop an ICD mixture model for
      text, the focused topic model (FTM), and show superior performance over the
      HDP-based topic model.

    abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy exploits the magnetic
      properties of atomic nuclei to discover the structure, reaction state and chemical
      environment of molecules. We propose a probabilistic generative model and inference
      procedures for NMR spectroscopy. Specifically, we use a weighted sum of trigonometric
      functions undergoing exponential decay to model free induction decay (FID) signals.
      We discuss the challenges in estimating the components of this general model
      – amplitudes, phase shifts, frequencies, decay rates, and noise variances –
      and offer practical solutions. We compare with conventional Fourier transform
      spectroscopy for estimating the relative concentrations of chemicals in a mixture,
      using synthetic and experimentally acquired FID signals. We find the proposed
      model is particularly robust to low signal to noise ratios (SNR), and overlapping
      peaks in the Fourier transform of the FID, enabling accurate predictions (e.g.,
      1% error at low SNR) which are not possible with conventional spectroscopy (5%
      error).

    abstract: We present a non-parametric Bayesian approach to structure learning
      with hidden causes. Previous Bayesian treatments of this problem define a prior
      over the number of hidden causes and use algorithms such as reversible jump
      Markov chain Monte Carlo to move between solutions. In contrast, we assume that
      the number of hidden causes is unbounded, but only a finite number influence
      observable variables. This makes it possible to use a Gibbs sampler to approximate
      the distribution over causal structures. We evaluate the performance of both
      approaches in discovering hidden causes in simulated data, and use our non-parametric
      approach to discover hidden causes in a real medical dataset.

    abstract: The accurate prediction of time-changing covariances is an important
      problem in the modeling of multivariate financial data. However, some of the
      most popular models suffer from a) overfitting problems and multiple local optima,
      b) failure to capture shifts in market conditions and c) large computational
      costs. To address these problems we introduce a novel dynamic model for time-changing
      covariances. Over-fitting and local optima are avoided by following a Bayesian
      approach instead of computing point estimates. Changes in market conditions
      are captured by assuming a diffusion process in parameter values, and finally
      computationally efficient and scalable inference is performed using particle
      filters. Experiments with financial data show excellent performance of the proposed
      method with respect to current standard models.

    abstract: 'The Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) is a widely used model for clustering
      and for general nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Unfortunately, like
      in many statistical models, exact inference in a DPM is intractable, and approximate
      methods are needed to perform efficient inference. While most attention in the
      literature has been placed on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) [1, 2, 3], variational
      Bayesian (VB) [4] and collapsed variational methods [5], [6] recently introduced
      a novel class of approximation for DPMs based on Bayesian hierarchical clustering
      (BHC). These tree-based combinatorial approximations efficiently sum over exponentially
      many ways of partitioning the data and offer a novel lower bound on the marginal
      likelihood of the DPM [6]. In this paper we make the following contributions:
      (1) We show empirically that the BHC lower bounds are substantially tighter
      than the bounds given by VB [4] and by collapsed variational methods [5] on
      synthetic and real datasets. (2) We also show that BHC offers a more accurate
      predictive performance on these datasets. (3) We further improve the tree-based
      lower bounds with an algorithm that efficiently sums contributions from alternative
      trees. (4) We present a fast approximate method for BHC. Our results suggest
      that our combinatorial approximate inference methods and lower bounds may be
      useful not only in DPMs but in other models as well.'

    abstract: The adoption of automated, data-driven decision making in an ever expanding
      range of applications has raised concerns about its potential unfairness towards
      certain social groups. In this context, a number of recent studies have focused
      on defining, detecting, and removing unfairness from data-driven decision systems.
      However, the existing notions of fairness, based on parity (equality) in treatment
      or outcomes for different social groups, tend to be needlessly stringent, limiting
      the overall decision making accuracy. In this paper, we draw inspiration from
      the fair-division and envy-freeness literature in economics and game theory
      and propose preference-based notions of fairness —- given the choice between
      various sets of decision treatments or outcomes, any group of users would collectively
      prefer its treatment or outcomes, regardless of the (dis)parity as compared
      to the other groups. Then, we introduce tractable proxies to design convex margin-based
      classifiers that satisfy these preference-based notions of fairness. Finally,
      we experiment with a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets and show that
      preference-based fairness allows for greater decision accuracy than parity-based
      fairness.

    abstract: Interactions among neurons are a key com- ponent of neural signal processing.
      Rich neural data sets potentially containing evidence of interactions can now
      be collected readily in the laboratory, but existing analysis methods are often
      not sufficiently sensitive and specific to reveal these interactions. Generalized
      linear models offer a platform for analyzing multi-electrode recordings of neuronal
      spike train data. Here we suggest an L1-regularized logistic regression model
      (L1L method) to detect short-term (order of 3ms) neuronal interactions. We estimate
      the parameters in this model using a coordinate descent algorithm, and determine
      the optimal tuning parameter using a Bayesian Information Criterion. Simulation
      studies show that in general the L1L method has better sensitivities and specificities
      than those of the traditional shuffle-corrected cross-correlogram (covariogram)
      method. The L1L method is able to detect excitatory interactions with both high
      sensitivity and specificity with reasonably large recordings, even when the
      magnitude of the interactions is small; similar results hold for inhibition
      given sufficiently high baseline firing rates. Our study also suggests that
      the false positives can be further removed by thresholding, because their magnitudes
      are typically smaller than true interactions. Simulations also show that the
      L1L method is somewhat robust to partially observed networks. We apply the method
      to multi-electrode recordings collected in the monkey dorsal premotor cortex
      (PMd) while the animal prepares to make reaching arm movements. The results
      show that some neurons interact differently depending on task conditions. The
      stronger interactions detected with our L1L method were also visible using the
      covariogram method.

      to be generated from independent sources which account for the relatedness of
      the tasks. We use Laplace distributions to model hidden sources which makes
      it possible to identify the hidden, independent components instead of just modeling

    abstract: 'Given multiple prediction problems such as regression and classification,
      we are interested in a joint inference framework which can effectively borrow

      the number of training examples per problem is small. In this paper we propose
      a probabilistic framework which can support a set of latent variable models

      generalization of standard learning methods for single prediction problems and
      it can effectively model the shared structure among different prediction tasks.
      Furthermore, we present efficient algorithms for the empirical Bayes method
      as well as point estimation. Our experiments on both simulated datasets and
      real world classification datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed models

    abstract: Continuous relaxations play an important role in discrete optimization,
      but have not seen much use in approximate probabilistic inference. Here we show
      that a general form of the Gaussian Integral Trick makes it possible to transform
      a wide class of discrete variable undirected models into fully continuous systems.
      The continuous representation allows the use of gradient-based Hamiltonian Monte
      Carlo for inference, results in new ways of estimating normalization constants
      (partition functions), and in general opens up a number of new avenues for inference
      in difficult discrete systems. We demonstrate some of these continuous relaxation
      inference algorithms on a number of illustrative problems.

    abstract: An approach to semi-supervised learning is proposed that is based on
      a Gaussian random field model. Labeled and unlabeled data are represented as
      vertices in a weighted graph, with edge weights encoding the similarity between
      instances. The learning problem is then formulated in terms of a Gaussian random
      field on this graph, where the mean of the field is characterized in terms of
      harmonic functions, and is efficiently obtained using matrix methods or belief
      propagation. The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with
      random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods
      to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classifiers obtained by supervised
      learning. We also propose a method of parameter learning by entropy minimization,
      and show the algorithm's ability to perform feature selection. Promising experimental
      results are presented for synthetic data, digit classification, and text classification
      tasks.

    abstract: We present an algorithm based on convex optimization for constructing
      kernels for semi-supervised learning. The kernel matrices are derived from the
      spectral decomposition of graph Laplacians, and combine labeled and unlabeled
      data in a systematic fashion. Unlike previous work using diffusion kernels and
      Gaussian random field kernels, a nonparametric kernel approach is presented
      that incorporates order constraints during optimization. This results in flexible
      kernels and avoids the need to choose among different parametric forms. Our
      approach relies on a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP), and
      is computationally feasible for large datasets. We evaluate the kernels on real
      datasets using support vector machines, with encouraging results.

    abstract: Criminal justice is an increasingly important application domain for
      machine learning and algorithmic fairness, as predictive tools are becoming
      widely used in police, courts, and prison systems worldwide. A few relevant
      benchmarks have received significant attention, e.g., the COMPAS dataset, often
      without proper consideration of the domain context. To raise awareness of publicly
      available criminal justice datasets and encourage their responsible use, we
      conduct a survey, consider contexts, highlight potential uses, and identify
      gaps and limitations. We provide datasheets for 15 datasets and upload them
      to a public repository. We compare the datasets across several dimensions, including
      size, coverage of the population, and potential use, highlighting concerns.
      We hope that this work can provide a useful starting point for researchers looking
      for appropriate datasets related to criminal justice, and that the repository
      will continue to grow as a community effort.

    abstract: 'We present a survey of tools used in the criminal justice system in
      the UK in three categories: data infrastructure, data analysis, and risk prediction.
      Many tools are currently in deployment, offering potential benefits, including
      improved efficiency and consistency. However, there are also important concerns.
      Transparent information about these tools, their purpose, how they are used,
      and by whom is difficult to obtain. Even when information is available, it is
      often insufficient to enable a satisfactory evaluation. More work is needed
      to establish governance mechanisms to ensure that tools are deployed in a transparent,
      safe and ethical way. We call for more engagement with stakeholders and greater
      documentation of the intended goal of a tool, how it will achieve this goal
      compared to other options, and how it will be monitored in deployment. We highlight
      additional points to consider when evaluating the trustworthiness of deployed
      tools and make concrete proposals for policy.'

    abstract: The task of infomin learning aims to learn a representation with high
      utility while being uninformative about a specified target, with the latter
      achieved by minimising the mutual information between the representation and
      the target. It has broad applications, ranging from training fair prediction
      models against protected attributes, to unsupervised learning with disentangled
      representations. Recent works on infomin learning mainly use adversarial training,
      which involves training a neural network to estimate mutual information or its
      proxy and thus is slow and difficult to optimise. Drawing on recent advances
      in slicing techniques, we propose a new infomin learning approach, which uses
      a novel proxy metric to mutual information. We further derive an accurate and
      analytically computable approximation to this proxy metric, thereby removing
      the need of constructing neural network-based mutual information estimators.
      Compared to baselines, experiments on algorithmic fairness, disentangled representation
      learning and domain adaptation verify that our method can more effectively remove
      unwanted information with limited time budget.

  ge2015dirichlet:
    abstract: Bayesian nonparametric mixture models based on the Dirichlet process
      (DP) have been widely used for solving problems like clustering, density estimation
      and topic modelling. These models make weak assumptions about the underlying
      process that generated the observed data. Thus, when more data are collected,
      the complexity of these models can change accordingly. These theoretical properties
      often lead to superior predictive performance when compared to traditional finite
      mixture models. However, despite the increasing amount of data available, the
      application of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models is so far limited to relatively
      small data sets. In this paper, we propose an efficient distributed inference
      algorithm for the DP and the HDP mixture model. The proposed method is based
      on a variant of the slice sampler for DPs. Since this sampler does not involve
      a pre-determined truncation, the stationary distribution of the sampling algorithm
      is unbiased. We provide both local thread-level and distributed machine-level
      parallel implementations and study the performance of this sampler through an
      extensive set of experiments on image and text data. When compared to existing
      inference algorithms, the proposed method exhibits state-of-the-art accuracy
      and strong scalability with up to 512 cores.

    abstract: 'Probabilistic programming promises to simplify and democratize probabilistic
      machine learning, but successful probabilistic programming systems require flexible,
      generic and efficient inference engines. In this work, we present a system called
      Turing for building MCMC algorithms for probabilistic programming inference.
      Turing has a very simple syntax and makes full use of the numerical capabilities
      in the Julia programming language, including all implemented probability distributions,
      and automatic differentiation. Turing supports a wide range of popular Monte
      Carlo algorithms, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), HMC with No-U-Turns
      (NUTS), Gibbs sampling, sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), and several particle MCMC
      (PMCMC) samplers. Most importantly, Turing inference is composable: it combines
      MCMC operations on subsets of variables, for example using a combination of
      an HMC engine and a particle Gibbs (PG) engine. We explore several combinations
      of inference methods with the aim of finding approaches that are both efficient
      and universal, i.e. applicable to arbitrary probabilistic models. NUTS—a popular
      variant of HMC that adapts Hamiltonian simulation path length automatically,
      although quite powerful for exploring differentiable target distributions, is
      however not universal. We identify some failure modes for the NUTS engine, and
      demonstrate that composition of PG (for discrete variables) and NUTS (for continuous
      variables) can be useful when the NUTS engine is either not applicable, or simply
      does not work well. Our aim is to present Turing and its composable inference
      engines to the world and encourage other researchers to build on this system
      to help advance the field of probabilistic machine learning.'

  tazi2022pyrocast:
    abstract: Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds are storm clouds generated by extreme
      wildfires. PyroCbs are associated with unpredictable, and therefore dangerous,
      wildfire spread. They can also inject smoke particles and trace gases into the
      upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, affecting the Earth's climate. As
      global temperatures increase, these previously rare events are becoming more
      common. Being able to predict which fires are likely to generate pyroCb is therefore
      key to climate adaptation in wildfire-prone areas. This paper introduces Pyrocast,
      a pipeline for pyroCb analysis and forecasting. The pipeline's first two components,
      a pyroCb database and a pyroCb forecast model, are presented. The database brings
      together geostationary imagery and environmental data for over 148 pyroCb events
      across North America, Australia, and Russia between 2018 and 2022. Random Forests,
      Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and CNNs pretrained with Auto-Encoders
      were tested to predict the generation of pyroCb for a given fire six hours in
      advance. The best model predicted pyroCb with an AUC of 0.90±0.04.

    abstract: 'Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is a popular sampling method in Bayesian
      inference. Recently, Heng    amp; Jacob (2019) studied Metropolis HMC with couplings
      for unbiased Monte Carlo estimation, establishing a generic parallelizable scheme
      for HMC. However, in practice a different HMC method, multinomial HMC, is considered
      as the go-to method, e.g. as part of the no-U-turn sampler. In multinomial HMC,
      proposed states are not limited to end-points as in Metropolis HMC; instead
      points along the entire trajectory can be proposed. In this paper, we establish
      couplings for multinomial HMC, based on optimal transport for multinomial sampling
      in its transition. We prove an upper bound for the meeting time – the time it
      takes for the coupled chains to meet – based on the notion of local contractivity.
      We evaluate our methods using three targets: 1,000 dimensional Gaussians, logistic
      regression and log-Gaussian Cox point processes. Compared to Heng    amp; Jacob
      (2019), coupled multinomial HMC generally attains a smaller meeting time, and
      is more robust to choices of step sizes and trajectory lengths, which allows
      re-use of existing adaptation methods for HMC. These improvements together paves
      the way for a wider and more practical use of coupled HMC methods.'
