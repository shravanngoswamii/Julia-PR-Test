# This script inserts a top navigation bar (e.g., `navbar.html`) into Documenter.jl generated sites.
# The resulting output is similar to MultiDocumenter's navigation menu. The navigation menu is
# hard-coded at the moment, which could be improved in the future. 
# It checks all HTML files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
# The script also avoids inserting the navbar if it's already present.

# URL of the navigation bar HTML file

# Check if the download was successful
